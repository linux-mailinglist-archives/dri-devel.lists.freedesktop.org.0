Can you explain a bit about /how/ it is unstable?

As you write, usb_bulk_msg() (as used before) has a timeout which is
passed to the host controller hardware and implemented there.

I haven't used SG with kernel USB but I would expect such a timeout
to still be available with SG?

The device not responding to bulk packets scheduled and sent by the host
is a real error /in the device/ and thus not neccessarily something the
kernel must handle gracefully.. I think it's quite nice to do so, but
one can argue that it's not strictly required.

But more importantly: Remember that bulk transfer has no delivery time
guarantee. It can take indefinitely long until a bulk transfer is
scheduled by the host on a busy bus which is starved with more
important things (control, interrupt, iso transfers) - that's not
an error at all, and may be indistinguishable from the device not
responding to packets actually sent by the host.

Having a timeout is important, I just expect the USB SG interface to
support it since it is the hardware that times out in the non-SG case.


And since this is essentially real time data maybe a shorter timeout
is better? 3 seconds seems really long.

The timeout must include all latency for a frame, so e.g. 16ms (60 Hz)
is too short for sure. But maybe something like 500ms?
