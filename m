Hi Oak,

yeah, #4 is indeed a really good point and I think Felix will agree to 
that as well.

HMM is basically still missing a way to advise device attributes for the 
CPU address space. Both migration strategy as well as device specific 
information (like cache preferences) fall into this category.

Since there is a device specific component in those attributes as well I 
think device specific IOCTLs still make sense to update them, but HMM 
should offer the functionality to manage and store those information.

Split and merge of VMAs only become a problem if you attach those 
information to VMAs, if you keep them completely separate than that 
doesn't become an issue either. The down side of this approach is that 
you don't get automatically extending attribute ranges for growing VMAs 
for example.

Regards,
Christian.

Since the current GPU driver uses a hmm based implementation (AMD and NV has done this; At Intel we are catching up), I want to explore how much we can benefit from the proposed approach and how your approach can solve some pain points of our development. So basically what I am questioning here is: what is the advantage of your approach against hmm.

My understanding is, even though you generalized this a bit, such as modified cpu page fault path, provided "general" gm_dev_fault handler... but device driver still need to provide migration functions because migration functions have to be device specific (i.e., using device dma/copy engine for performance purpose). Right?

Right now device driver has to maintain certain virtual address range data structure to maintain hints and other virtual address range based memory attributes. Driver need to sync with linux vma. Driver need to explicitly deal with range split/merging... HMM doesn't provide support in this area. Your approach seems cleaner/simpler to me...

I think for #1 and #2, hmm has provide pretty good abstraction/tools for address space mirroring and migration helpers. For #3, since we have a common drm/buddy layer, I don't think it is a big problem for driver writer now.
