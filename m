Enable appropriate debugging bits in /sys/module/drm/parameters/debug, reproduce problem, (disable debugging bits again), check dmesg.

Right now, if you don't wait for any pending page flip to complete before 
drmModeSetCrtc, the two may race, and the CRTC may end up scanning out from the FB set by the page flip.

Maybe this race should be prevented in the kernel though.

There's no need to wait for vblank.


I have to defer to others for your other questions.
