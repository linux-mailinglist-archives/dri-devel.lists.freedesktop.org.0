Well that's the point I don't really understand. Why would a driver want 
to do this?

It's perfectly possible that you have ttm_range_manager extended and a 
potential ttm_page_manager, but that are two different objects then 
which also need different handling.

Why? They all implement different handling.

When you add a private point to ttm_resource you allow common handling 
which doesn't take into account that this ttm_resource object is 
subclassed.

ttm_buffer_object is a subclass of drm_gem_object and I hope to make 
ttm_device a subclass of drm_device in the near term.

I really try to understand what you mean hear, but I even after reading 
that multiple times I absolutely don't get it.

Christian.
