Unfortunately, that's not a requirement you can encode in the Rust type
system easily as far as I know, and Rust safety rules mean we need to
make it safe even if the upper layer doesn't do this... (or else we have
to mark the entire drm_sched abstraction unsafe, but that would be a pity).

I know it's a different way of thinking, but it has pretty clear
benefits since with Rust you can actually guarantee that things are safe
overall by just auditing explicitly unsafe code. If we just mark all of
drm_sched unsafe, that means we now need to audit all details about how
the driver uses it for safety. It makes more sense to just make the
abstraction safe, which is much easier to audit.

The firmware queue is itself reference counted and any firmware queue
that has acquired an event notification resource (that is, which is busy
with running or upcoming jobs) hands off a reference to itself into the
event subsystem, so it can get notified of job completions by the
firmware. Then once it becomes idle it unregisters itself, and at that
point if it has no owning userspace queue, that would be the last
reference and it gets dropped. So we don't tear down firmware queues
until they are idle.

(There is a subtle deadlock break in the event module to make this work
out, where we clone a reference to the queue and drop the event
subsystem lock before signaling it of completions, so it can call back
in and take the lock as it unregisters itself if needed. Then the actual
teardown happens when the signaling is complete and that reference clone
is the last one to get dropped.)

If a queue is idle at the firmware level but has upcoming jobs queued in
drm_sched, when those get deleted as part of an explicit drm_sched
teardown (free_job()) the queue notices it lost its upcoming jobs and
relinquishes the event resource if there are no running jobs. I'm not
even sure exactly what order this all happens in in practice (it depends
on structure field order in Rust!), but it doesn't really matter because
either way everything gets cleaned up one way or another.

I actually don't know of any way to actively abort jobs on the firmware,
so this is pretty much the only option I have. I've even seen
long-running compute jobs on macOS run to completion even if you kill
the submitting process, so there might be no way to do this at all.
Though in practice since we unmap everything from the VM anyway when the
userspace stuff gets torn down, almost any normal GPU work is going to
immediately fault at that point (macOS doesn't do this because macOS
effectively does implicit sync with BO tracking at the kernel level...).

By the way, I don't really use the hardware recovery stuff right now.
I'm not even sure if there is a sensible way I could use it, since as I
said we can't exactly abort jobs. I know there are ways to lock up the
firmware/GPU, but so far those have all been things the kernel driver
can prevent, and I'm not even sure if there is any way to recover from
that anyway. The firmware itself has its own timeouts and recovery for
"normal" problems. From the point of view of the driver and everything
above it, in-flight commands during a GPU fault or timeout are just
marked complete by the firmware, after a firmware recovery cycle where
the driver gets notified of the problem (that's when we mark the
commands failed so we can propagate the error). There is no
re-submission or anything, userspace just gets told of the problem but
the queue survives. In the future it might be possible to re-submit
innocent commands (it is possible for a GPU fault to break another
process running concurrently, and this is a problem macOS has too...),
which is still not perfect due to side effects but might work most of
the time, but that depends on the "command patching" stuff I mentioned,
and I'm still not even sure if it will be possible to do safely. There's
a lot of subtlety around what we can and can't do during a firmware
recovery cycle that I haven't even started to investigate yet (the
answer could be "nothing" even).
