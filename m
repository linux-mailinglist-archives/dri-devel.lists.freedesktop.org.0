I had the same thoughts, because softdeps are for optional module
dependencies, while in this case it's a hard dependency.  Though,
I went with adding a softdep, simply because I saw no better option
available.

I also thought about making devfreq optional in the Lima driver,
which would make this additional softdep much more appropriate.
Though, I'm not really sure that's a good approach, because not
having working devfreq for Lima might actually cause issues on
some devices, such as increased power consumption.

In other words, it might be better to have Lima probing fail if
devfreq can't be initialized, rather than having probing succeed
with no working devfreq.  Basically, failed probing is obvious,
while a warning in the kernel log about no devfreq might easily
be overlooked, causing regressions on some devices.

I see, but I'm not really sure how to make it more robust?  In
the end, some user can blacklist the simple_ondemand governor
module, and we can't do much about it.

Introducing harddeps alongside softdeps would make sense from
the design standpoint, but the amount of required changes wouldn't
be trivial at all, on various levels.
