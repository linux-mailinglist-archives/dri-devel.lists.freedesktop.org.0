I asked Thomas to take a more detailed look. Jonathan, Thomas really should
have been Cc'd in the original patch as the patch was explicitly referred
in the text even.

Fear not. This can probably be blamed on the i915 maintainers.

When we have an internal patch which has many revisions and is then
essentially rewritten for upstreaming, we specifically asked NOT to keep
the "From:" line intact, but instead swap in person who rewrote the patch[1=
].

To document credits/involvement of the original author we've recommended
to keep the Signed-off-by line however. "Co-developed-by" does not really
express the situation correctly. "Based on patch by" style pure textual
credit reference was also discussed but is hard to grep.

Discussed with Sima who suggested if we should consider something like
"Original-patch-by:" tag to better express this situation?

Regards, Joonas

[1] If the "From: " line is not updated, it sometimes leads to
situation where you can see a patch with "From:" pointing to you, that
doesn't contain a single unmodified line anymore.
