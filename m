So no flags? Or just the default behavior is I915_PARALLEL_IMPLICIT_BONDS |
I915_PARALLEL_NO_PREEMPT_MID_BATCH for now, the flags are unused, but could be
used in the future if needed?

Not sure what you mean by an engine flags. This is a per context concept.

Right, this can only be called at context creation.
