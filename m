Hi,

chained to this message is a driver for CH7033 along with device tree
binding docs. I'm hoping that it could perhaps make it into 5.7. Please
take a look.

Previous submission [1] contained the exact same patches as this one,
but at that time they relied on Laurent's omapdrm/bridge/devel branch that
has been merged since.

[1] https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200221162743.14141-1-lkundrak@v3.sk/

Tested to work well on MMP3-based Dell Wyse 3020. There's no datasheet or
programming manual available.

Thanks,
Lubo
