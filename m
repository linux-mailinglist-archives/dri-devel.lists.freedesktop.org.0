V8 of the patchset fixes more bitrot and some commit messages.

The pdev field in struct drm_device points to a PCI device structure and
goes back to UMS-only days when all DRM drivers were for PCI devices.
Meanwhile we also support USB, SPI and platform devices. Each of those
uses the generic device stored in struct drm_device.dev.

To reduce duplication and remove the special case of PCI, this patchset
converts all modesetting drivers from pdev to dev and makes pdev a field
for legacy UMS drivers.

For PCI devices, the pointer in struct drm_device.dev can be upcasted to
struct pci_device; or tested for PCI with dev_is_pci(). In several places
the code can use the dev field directly.

After converting all drivers and the DRM core, the pdev fields becomes
only relevant for legacy drivers. In a later patchset, we may want to
convert these as well and remove pdev entirely.

v8:
	* fix pdev bitrot in ast
	* fix commit messages (Michael)
v7:
	* fix instances of pdev that have benn added under i915/
v6:
	* also remove assignment in i915/selftests in later patch (Chris)
v5:
	* remove assignment in later patch (Chris)
v4:
	* merged several patches
	* moved core changes into separate patch
	* vmwgfx build fix
v3:
	* merged several patches
	* fix one pdev reference in nouveau (Jeremy)
	* rebases
v2:
	* move whitespace fixes into separate patches (Alex, Sam)
	* move i915 gt/ and gvt/ changes into separate patches (Joonas)

Thomas Zimmermann (5):
  drm/ast: Remove reference to struct drm_device.pdev
  drm/i915/gt: Remove reference to struct drm_device.pdev
  drm/i915: Remove reference to struct drm_device.pdev
  drm/i915: Don't assign to struct drm_device.pdev
  drm: Move struct drm_device.pdev to legacy section
