From: Matthew Auld <matthew.auld@intel.com>

On discrete platforms like DG2, we need to support a minimum page size
of 64K when dealing with device local-memory. This is quite tricky for
various reasons, so try to document the new implicit uapi for this.

v4: Kdoc modification.
v3: fix typos and less emphasis
v2: Fixed suggestions on formatting [Daniel]

+	 * On discrete platforms, starting from DG2, we have to contend with GTT

+	 * objects.  Specifically the hardware only supports 64K or larger GTT
+	 * page sizes for such memory. The kernel will already ensure that all

+	 *
+	 * Note that the returned size here will always reflect any required
+	 * rounding up done by the kernel, i.e 4K will now become 64K on devices
+	 * such as DG2.
+	 *
+	 * Special DG2 GTT address alignment requirement:
+	 *
+	 * The GTT alignment will also need to be at least 2M for such objects.
+	 *
+	 * Note that due to how the hardware implements 64K GTT page support, we
+	 * have some further complications:
+	 *
+	 *   1) The entire PDE (which covers a 2MB virtual address range), must
+	 *   contain only 64K PTEs, i.e mixing 4K and 64K PTEs in the same
+	 *   PDE is forbidden by the hardware.
+	 *
+	 *   2) We still need to support 4K PTEs for I915_MEMORY_CLASS_SYSTEM
+	 *   objects.
+	 *
+	 * To keep things simple for userland, we mandate that any GTT mappings
+	 * must be aligned to and rounded up to 2MB. The kernel will internally
+	 * pad them out to the next 2MB boundary. As this only wastes virtual
+	 * address space and avoids userland having to copy any needlessly
+	 * complicated PDE sharing scheme (coloring) and only affects DG2, this
+	 * is deemed to be a good compromise.
