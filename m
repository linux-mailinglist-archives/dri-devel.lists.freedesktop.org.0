For a specific example, https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/-/merge_requests/1620 allows app-to-screen latency as low as ~6 ms (including a fixed 2 ms buffer to avoid skipped frames). mutter doesn't use KMS planes yet, but if anything I'd expect that to help rather than hurt for latency (if the compositor doesn't need to draw anything).
