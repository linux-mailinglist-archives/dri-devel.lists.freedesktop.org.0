Sounds like a fair enough requirement but if drivers will not be 
comfortable with the wq conversion, it is probably possible to introduce 
some vfuncs for the 1:1 case which would allow scheduler users override 
the scheduler wakeup and select a special "pick one job" path. That 
could allow 1:1 users do their thing, leaving rest as is. I mean you 
already have the special single entity scheduler, you'd just need to add 
some more specialization on the init, wake up, etc paths.

And I will mention once more that I find a wq item with a loop such as:

	while (!READ_ONCE(sched->pause_run_wq)) {
	...

A bit dodgy. If you piggy back on any system_wq it smells of system wide 
starvation so for me any proposal with an option to use a system shared 
wq is a no go.

Tvrtko
