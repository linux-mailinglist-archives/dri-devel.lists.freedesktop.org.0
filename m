I agree that probing *any* PCI device should never have been introduced,
much less made the default.  But changing that risks regressing
users that depend on it.

The conservative approach is to retain the existing behavior,
but make it more benign by constraining probing to devices with
AGP Capability, as we did prior to 6fd024893911.

Thanks,
