Some of our upcoming platforms, including the Xe_HP SDV, support a
"multi-tile" design.  A multi-tile platform is effectively a platform
with multiple GT instances and local memory regions, all behind a single
PCI device.  From an i915 perspective, this translates to multiple
intel_gt structures per drm_i915_private.  This series provides the
initial refactoring to support multiple independent GTs per card, but
further work (especially related to local memory) will be required to
fully enable a multi-tile platform.

Note that the presence of multiple GTs is largely transparent to
userspace.  A multi-tile platform will advertise a larger list of
engines to userspace, but the concept of "tile" is not something
userspace has to worry about directly.  There will be some uapi
implications later due to the devices having multiple local memory
regions, but that aspect of multi-tile is not covered by this patch
series and will show up in future work.

v2:
 - Include some additional tile setup refactoring that got missed in v1.

v3:
 - Fix GEM_BUG_ON() assertion on pre-gen9 platforms; the assertion was
   only meant for multi-tile platforms and will always fail on old
   platforms that have a BAR0 smaller than 16MB.
 - Rename some of the gt/tile initialization functions.  (Lucas/Jani)
 - Move top-level tile memory init to i915_drv.c since it isn't directly
   related to the GT.  (Lucas)
 - Squash per-gt cleanup into the patch that introduces the per-gt
   setup.
 - Fix handling of display and GSE interrupts (our current multi-tile
   platforms don't have display, but we can't count on that being true
   in the future).
