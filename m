            Bug ID: 206577
           Summary: Periodic screen blanking at a high refresh rate and
                    resolution
           Product: Drivers
           Version: 2.5
    Kernel Version: 5.5
          Hardware: All
                OS: Linux
              Tree: Mainline
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
          Priority: P1
         Component: Video(DRI - non Intel)
          Assignee: drivers_video-dri@kernel-bugs.osdl.org
          Reporter: tombazley@outlook.com
        Regression: No

Using a Samsung LC43J892DKUXEN 43" monitor with a Vega 64. 

I am unable to set the display output to 3840x1200 @ 120Hz. At 100Hz the
display behaves as expected, however at 120Hz the display will turn black
briefly as if there is a power loss or as if the source input has changed. This
will repeat maybe a couple of times every minute. 

I have tested using a ROG Strix RX VEGA64 OC edition and a Sapphire Radeon RX
VEGA 64 Nitro+. 

I've tested on linux 5.5.2 and mesa 19.3.3, as well as on driver versions
19.9.3, 19.12.3, 19.7.5, 19.12.2, 20.1.1, and 20.2.1 on Windows. I submitted
this issue to the AMD bug report a few weeks ago but haven't heard anything
back from them, so I am submitting here as well. 

I had the monitor sent back to Samsung for testing. They used a STRIX GTX950
and had no issues. 

I have tried multiple DisplayPort cables including the one included with the
monitor.
