Hi Christian,

CC'ing James as I think this is related to his work on the unix device
memory allocator ([1]).

I'll start with a few high-level comments/questions:

- Instead of tying drivers to heaps, have you considered a system where
  a driver would expose constraints, and a heap would then be selected
  based on those constraints ? A tight coupling between heaps and
  drivers means downstream patches to drivers in order to use
  vendor-specific heaps, that sounds painful.

  A constraint-based system would also, I think, be easier to extend
  with additional constraints in the future.

- I assume some drivers will be able to support multiple heaps. How do
  you envision this being implemented ?

- Devices could have different constraints based on particular
  configurations. For instance, a device may require specific memory
  layout for multi-planar YUV formats only (as in allocating the Y and C
  planes of NV12 from different memory banks). A dynamic API may thus be
  needed (but may also be very painful to use from userspace).

https://git.libcamera.org/libcamera/libcamera.git/ would be a good place
to prototype userspace support :-)
