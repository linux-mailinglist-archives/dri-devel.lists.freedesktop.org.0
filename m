CC: +Paolo Bonzini who introduced this code

commit add6a0cd1c5ba51b201e1361b05a5df817083618
Author: Paolo Bonzini <pbonzini@redhat.com>
Date:   Tue Jun 7 17:51:18 2016 +0200

    KVM: MMU: try to fix up page faults before giving up

    The vGPU folks would like to trap the first access to a BAR by setting
    vm_ops on the VMAs produced by mmap-ing a VFIO device.  The fault
handler
    then can use remap_pfn_range to place some non-reserved pages in the
VMA.

    This kind of VM_PFNMAP mapping is not handled by KVM, but follow_pfn
    and fixup_user_fault together help supporting it.  The patch also
supports
    VM_MIXEDMAP vmas where the pfns are not reserved and thus subject to
    reference counting.
