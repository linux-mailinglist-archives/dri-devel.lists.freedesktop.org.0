--- Comment #56 from Nicholas Kazlauskas <nicholas.kazlauskas@amd.com> ---
It seems to be the frequent calls to DRM_IOCTL_MODE_SETPROPERTY that's caus=
ing
the issue but I'm not entirely sure what specifically it's trying to set th=
at's
doing this.

This probably isn't triggering anything that really needs hardware programm=
ing
but it will end up waiting for all outstanding atomic commits to finish whi=
ch
would likely explain the stuttering.

Does this patch improve the issue?
