I think we want both.

1) I think the suggestion was to store the data directly in nvkm_gr, however the
   structure is indeed specific to r535, so I think, unfortunately, we need the
   vtable and store that data in r535_gr.

2) Yes, this should be passed through nvif. Unfortunately, I think it would need
   to be a whole new one (similar to the fifo one).

Maybe Ben can provide you some additional pointers one this? Mayber he can
suggest a shortcut, since he has patches queued to simplify the whole interface.
