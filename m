Component is for something that is possible not available. (or something 
is optional)

Yes it provided flexibly, but don't forget, it rely on the DT.


But for the PCIe device, it always the case that all of the hardware is 
available at the same time

when the device driver(kernel module) is loaded.

A display controller, HDMI phy, vga encoder etc


I have a discrete PCIe GPU card from another vendor,

It integrated display controller and vivante GPU and unknown VPUs.

All of theÂ  hardware block mentioned above sharing the MMIO space.

There are available on the same time when you mount this discrete PCIe 
GPU card on the mother board
