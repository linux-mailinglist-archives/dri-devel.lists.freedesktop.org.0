cpumask_var_t is not going to be the right type for anything else that is
not a cpumask, as that is limited by NR_CPUS.

You'd have to declare a new bitmap, suitable for generic devices, which may
get a little complicated on deciding how many bits would be enough... and
if we look at GPUs... AMD and nV have lots of cores, so that becomes a bit
unfeasible to put in a bitmap.

Not sure then how generic that would be.

I don't really like seeing more and more vendor specific APIs: MediaTek does
suffer quite a lot from that, with cmdq being one of the examples - and the
fact that it's not just MediaTek having those, but also others like Qualcomm,
Rockchip, etc, is not an excuse to keep adding new ones when there are other
alternatives.

Also another fact there is that I don't think that panthor should get any
vendor specific "things" added (I mean, that should be avoided as much as
possible).

That said - what you will be trying to pass is really a value that is read
from eFuse, with the EB firmware being a wrapper over that: if we want, we
could see that yet-another-way of interfacing ourselves with reading nvmem
where, instead of a direct MMIO read, we're asking a firmware to give us a
readout.

This leads me to think that one of the possible options could be to actually
register (perhaps as a new platform device, because I'm not sure that it could
be feasible to register a pmdomain driver as a nvmem provider, but ultimately
that is Ulf and Srinivas' call I guess) a nvmem driver that makes an IPI call
to GPUEB and gives back the value to panthor through generic bindings.

Failing during probe doesn't make this much of a working (probed -> bound) device,
