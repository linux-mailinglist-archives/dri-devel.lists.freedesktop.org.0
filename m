Ok, sounds like some more investigation is needed. I'm a little wary of
a new feature which has a FIXME like this as it sounds like the design
hasn't been tested yet. I'm happy with the current code if it's indeed
"good enough", but if it's still too slow to be actually usable then I
think we need to fix it before merging rather than have a new feature
which isn't actually fast enough to use.

Yeah I think that's cleanest. Please do include a comment in the uapi
file about the 2^32-1 limit though.

Thanks,
