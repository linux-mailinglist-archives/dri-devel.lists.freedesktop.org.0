Well my main goal is to get rid of the debugfs_init() mid-layering in 
the mid term, everything else is just nice to have.

Oh, good idea! That would also finally make it a bit less problematic to 
figure out which PCI or platform device corresponds to which debugfs 
directory.

Only potential problem I see is that we would need to rename the 
directory should a driver every decide to set drm_dev->unique to 
something else than the default. But a quick check shows no users of 
drm_dev_set_unique(), so we could potentially just unexport the function

How about we just create symlinks between the old and the new directory 
for now which we remove after everything has settled again?

> Also what regarding sysfs ? Should we do something with accel_sysfs_device_minor ?

I see sysfs as a different and probably even more complicated topic.

Christian.
