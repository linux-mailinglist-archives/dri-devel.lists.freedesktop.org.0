I was also planning to use connector type for conditionally setting the
HPD_DISABLE bit. But I see that renesas uses sn65dsi86 bridge
(arch/arm64/boot/dts/renesas/r8a779h0-gray-hawk-single.dts and two more
platforms) connected to mini-dp-connector which also had the connector
type DRM_MODE_CONNECTOR_DisplayPort.

After your changes, their platform will also get affected.
I would assume that even their platform needs HPD functionality. They
should also be getting "always connected" state for that connector.
But I don't see any reported issues for their platform.

As Doug proposed, we can use no-hpd in other platforms and not keep it
in our platforms.

(I will test your patch on TI platform.)

Warm Regards,
Jayesh
