So far we had the approach of using a directed acyclic
graph with the dma_resv obj.

This turned out to have many downsides, especially it means
that every single driver and user of this interface needs
to be aware of this restriction when adding fences. If the
rules for the DAG are not followed then we end up with
potential hard to debug memory corruption, information
leaks or even elephant big security holes because we allow
userspace to access freed up memory.

Since we already took a step back from that by always
looking at all fences we now go a step further and stop
dropping the shared fences when a new exclusive one is
added.

v2: Drop some now superflous documentation
