Hello Rob,

I want to remind you that in v2 of this series you said that it'd be wrong for
port@0 to be an output, I replied that you misread that as I had modeled it indeed
as an input, and then you gave me your Reviewed-by tag.

Anyway - I get your concern about the previous behavior of `port`, but I chose to
model this that way purely for consistency.

First of all - the driver(s) will check if we're feeding a full graph, as it will
indeed first check if port@1 is present: if it is, then it follows this scheme with
port@0 as INPUT and port@1 as OUTPUT.
If the component in port@0 is an OUTPUT, the bridge attach will fail.

Getting to bindings themselves, then... it would be a mistake to model port@0 as an
output and port@1 as an input, because that would be not only inconsistent with the
DRM Bridge bindings, but would be highly confusing when reading the devicetree.

Please note that the bridge bindings are always declaring port@0 as an INPUT and
other ports as OUTPUT(s).

As an example, you can check display/bridge/analogix,anx7625.yaml or
display/bridge/samsung,mipi-dsim.yaml (and others) for bridges, otherwise
display/st,stm32mp25-lvds.yaml or display/allwinner,sun4i-a10-display-frontend.yaml
(and others) for display controllers, which do all conform to this logic, where
the input is always @0, and the output is @1.

Of course, doing this required me to do extra changes to the MTK DRM drivers to
actually be retro-compatible with the old devicetrees as I explained before.

Just for clarity, if I were to model this with port@0 OUTPUT and @1 INPUT, we would
see in devicetree something like:

dpi-node@somewhere {
	ports {
		some_output_1: port@0 {
			remote-endpoint = <&some_input_2>;
		};
		some_input_1: port@1 {
			remote-endpoint = <&some_output_0>;
		};
};

/* already existing bridge binding, not touched by this commit */
bridge@somewhere-else {
	ports {
		some_input_2: port@0 {
			remote-endpoint = <&some_output_1>;
		};
		some_output_2: port@1 {
			remote-endpoint = <&to_display_input>;
		};
};

...and I think that you agree with me that this would be at least confusing for
whoever reads the DT (and again, IMO, inconsistent and simply wrong).

Instead, with the model proposed in this commit, we will have consistency:

dpi-node@somewhere {
	ports {
		some_input_1: port@1 {
			remote-endpoint = <&some_output_0>;
		};
		some_output_1: port@0 {
			remote-endpoint = <&some_input_2>;
		};
};

/* already existing bridge binding, not touched by this commit */
bridge@somewhere-else {
	ports {
		some_input_2: port@0 {
			remote-endpoint = <&some_output_1>;
		};
		some_output_2: port@1 {
			remote-endpoint = <&to_display_input>;
		};
};

...still, again, all this while still supporting the old device trees (which I plan
to update as soon as possible anyway, so that they're all using the full graph
instead of hardcoding board specific paths in the drivers).

Does this clarify to you the reasons why this was done like that?
If you have any other questions, I will be happy to clarify.

Cheers,
Angelo
