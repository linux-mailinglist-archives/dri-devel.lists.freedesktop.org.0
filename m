Order your patches finally. It's v12 and you still send binding after
the user. Read carefully submitting bindings/patches.

So this change moves to this patch.

No. You did not implement my comment at all.

So again:
"Why minItems? Nothing in this patch makes sense for me. Neither changing
existing binding nor new binding for rk3576."

To address such comment, come with reasonable answer to "why". Not just
send the same. It's a waste of my time to keep reviewing the same.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
