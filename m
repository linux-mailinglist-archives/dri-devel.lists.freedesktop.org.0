v2: possible_crtcs field is a bitmask, not a pointer. Suggested by
Ville Syrj채l채 <ville.syrjala@linux.intel.com>

v3: document how userspace should find out CRTC index. Also,
document that field 'gamma_size' represents the number of
entries in the lookup table. Suggested by Pekka Paalanen
<ppaalanen@gmail.com> and Daniel Vetter <daniel@ffwll.ch>

v4: document IN and OUT fields and make the description more
concise. Suggested by Pekka Paalanen <ppaalanen@gmail.com>

v5: CRTC index patch already merged, only patch to document drm_mode_get_plane
now. Added that gamma LUT size is deprecated and dropped incorrect text
documenting that plane number of formats may change from one ioctl to the
other. Suggested by Ville Syrj채l채 <ville.syrjala@linux.intel.com>

v6: document that gamma_size field was never used. Suggested by Pekka Paalanen
<ppaalanen@gmail.com> and Daniel Vetter <daniel@ffwll.ch>
