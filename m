So I think we managed to move the vblank code over to be crtc centric
except for the drm_vblank_init() call. That one is a bit awkward because
the code requires that vblank support is consistent across all crtc (or at
least I'd expect userspace to become unhappy), but with just per-crtc
hooks there's nothing to enforce that.

The other issue is that we still have the drm_device->vblank array, and
we'd need to move that into a crtc. That's mostly mechanical since we have
the drm_vblank_crtc(dev, pipe) lookup helper already, except we'd want to
avoid the crtc -> (dev, pipe) -> crtc roundtrip wherever possible. And
there's still some drivers left that deal with the old (dev, pipe)
convention.

On the C side this is handled by being really careful and by
drm_crtc_vblank_off flushing out all pending events. I guess it would be
nice if rust could do better here, but that depends upon what the
VblankRef users are doing exactly.

Note that these two functions are another great example of why we have to
link to the C side documentation, because there's some really strict rules
about when drivers supporting vblanks have to call these, or they're
breaking uapi contracts.

Yeah I think this is just the rust docs being too confused because they
drop too many details. The callbacks here are the hw side things that the
driver implements using hw interrupts. The VblankRef is much more a
userspace (or at least subsystem internal user) concept, and there's a
huge abstraction in between. There's a bunch of other cases where having
pending vblank events or a VblankRef does not imply that the hw interrupts
for vblank generation are actually on, for example self refresh displays.

Feels like trying to replicate docs in rust might be dangerous, because if
we have to keep really detailed and nuanced docs around in two places we
will fail.

Imo would be better to just explain how this maps to the C side and link
to that for full docs? Or somehow include that, but then all the
hyperlinks need to work from the C side kerneldoc or it's again
incomplete.
