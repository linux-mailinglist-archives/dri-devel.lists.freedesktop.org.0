--- Comment #6 from Richard Thier <u9vata@gmail.com> ---
Created attachment 144514
  --> https://bugs.freedesktop.org/attachment.cgi?id=3D144514&action=3Dedit
Added logging - magically works but slow from logging!

This is what I am running with now. There are no other changes and not desp=
ite
I gave back the commented-out earlier code part things do work, despite I h=
ave
only added comments....

pffff maybe it is working because of some weird waiting that the logs give
me...

I will attach the log that is generated, because things do not go in the
direction I was hoping for as I expected other code paths to happen when the
RADEON_HYPERZ=3D1 is on.
