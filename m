Fair enough, thanks for the description. We might need to coordinate to
get this looked at sooner if it's going to be blocking user submission.

Can we evict idle groups from the shrinker? User space already has to do
a little dance to work out whether it needs to "kick" the kernel to do
the submission. So it would be quite reasonable to extend the kick to
also pin the VM(s). The shrinker could then proactively evict idle
groups, and at that point it would be possible to unpin the memory.

I'm probably missing something, but that seems like a fairly solid
solution to me.

It's an awkward one because really you do want user space to free
buffers - generally the user space driver has a fairly large number of
buffers which are for temporary storage (and kept around to avoid the
overhead of freeing/allocating each frame). I know we've resorted to
idle timers in user space in an attempt to do this in the past - but
it's ugly.

Actual swapout can work, but it incurs a heavy penalty when the
application becomes active again. But I agree we should probably be
aiming to add support for this.
