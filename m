But you DW_MIPI patches for rk356x didn't come. So this is not keep 
consistency with this point.

Yes, we also have other interface , RK356X has LVDS/RGB/BT1120/BT656, 
RK3588 has BT1120/BT656, no LVDS or RGB.

If a device is supported for this soc, we will add dt node at the dtsi file.

A Kconfig dependencies don't seems a good idea.
