Only for mapping, and that's before the export -- if there's even a
struct page to begin with.

Totally agreed that nothing generic can rely on pages being transported
via dma-buf, and memfd is there if you do want a suitable transport. The
one I don't know about is dma-buf heap, do both parties there consent to
transport pages via the dma-buf? i.e. do they have special cases for
import/export between heaps?
