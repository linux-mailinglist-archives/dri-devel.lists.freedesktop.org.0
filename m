--- Comment #105 from Tom B <tom@r.je> ---
> Also, I considered that both of my monitors have audio out support. I won=
der if audio initialization might be the missing piece to the puzzle, the t=
hing that interrupts/changes the state of the card and prevents smu_send_sm=
c_msg_with_param from working where it did before. I know that in the past =
with previous AMD cards, display audio has been buggy .=20

I just tried setting admgpu.audio=3D0 and it didn't help. Though it doesn't=
 rule
out audio entirely, the audio backend is probably still used as part of the
connection to the monitor, I'd imagine it just prevents the card appearing =
as
an output device.
