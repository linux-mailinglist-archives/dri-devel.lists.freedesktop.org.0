I am very happy to see some interest in VKMS development, do you have a 
specific feature that you want to test?

That the whole point of "V"KMS, everything is virtual, even the display 
output :)

There are two way to get some information about the output content:
- CRC compuation [1]
- Writeback connector [2]

The CRC will allows you to write a test like this:

	create_reference_image();
	ref_crc = grab_crc();

	test_procedure();
	test_crc = grab_crc();

	assert(ref_crc, test_crc);

This is used in the igt test "kms_plane" to test color conversion, they 
compute a reference CRC and then test the conversion between multiple 
formats [3].

The writeback connector is useful to grab a "screenshot" of the output, 
but it is a bit less efficient. It can be used when a simple "reference 
CRC" is not possible. 
To grab a picture from the writeback connector, you have to do something 
like this:

	setup_pipeline();
	wb_fb = create_fb();
	while (true) {
		send_fb_to_wb_connector(wb_fb);
		wait_for_picture();
		do_something_with_result(wb_fb);
	}

There is a writeback example in igt [4], but I don't know how it works.

I think this is the good direction, yes!

All your patches must be on top of drm-misc-next [5]. If you are not 
familiar with kernel contribution, I invite you to look at the kernel 
documentation [6] and at the amazing b4 tool [7].

For the implementation itself, I think you have to work in the function 
blend, probably around the fill_background function [8]. You also need to 
attach a BACKGROUND property on the CRTC [9]. I think you have to do it 
somewhere in crtc initialization [10].
