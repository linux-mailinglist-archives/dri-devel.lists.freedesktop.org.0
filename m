So far building system updates so heavy cpu load while playing only moderate
FHD video.  No freezes but I have seen a bit of the predicted judder.

I suspect the synchronization is preventing the freezes, and the judder hasn't
been /bad/.  But with different-refresh monitors (mine are both 60 Hz 4k
bigscreen TVs so same refresh), or trying 4k video, particularly 4k60 which my
system already struggles with, or possibly even both say 120 Hz monitors, the
judder would be noticeably worse.  The 4k30 and 4k60 youtube tests will
probably have to wait for tomorrow, tho, as I've been up near 24 now...
