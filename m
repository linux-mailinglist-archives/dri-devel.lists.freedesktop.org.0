Ok, that sounds different to how Nouveau works. The "largest set of 
instructions to submit a job" really is a given by how the hardware 
works rather than an arbitrary limit?

In Nouveau, userspace can submit an arbitrary amount of addresses of 
indirect bufferes containing the ring instructions. The ring on the 
kernel side takes the addresses of the indirect buffers rather than the 
instructions themself. Hence, technically there isn't really a limit on 
the amount of IBs submitted by a job except for the ring size.

As explained above, theoretically it could. It's only limited by the 
ring size.
