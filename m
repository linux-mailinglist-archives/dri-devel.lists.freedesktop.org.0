Yeah, I'm aware of that.

But we don't really need that for device we want to interop with 
userspace queues, don't we?

Agreed, but I don't see supporting sync_file and out fences as something 
necessarily.

As far as I can see we don't need to support that burden for the use 
cases we have for implicit sync.

And even if we have to it is possible to implement.

And that's what I disagree on.

Supporting implicit sync in the kernel for the functionality we need to 
amdgpu is relatively easily.

Change all of userspace to not rely on implicit sync any more is really 
hard compared to that.

Dropping implicit sync in userspace has a lot of advantage and should be 
pushed for, but not because it is a prerequisite of user fences.

Christian.
