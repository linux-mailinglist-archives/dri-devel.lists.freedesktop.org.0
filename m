That is (mostly) irrelevant when it comes to regressions.

Not sure, but I tend to thing that decision would better be left to the
stable team. Each developer will have a different opinion about what's
too risky or not and they might be in the better position to judge what
they want for their trees. A "Fixes:" tag thus still seems appropriate
here; will also tell downstream distros that might want to pick this up.
