For I2C messages, we need to prepare TREs for Config, Go and DMAs. 
However, if a large number of I2C messages are submitted then may may 
run out of memory for serving the TREs. The GPI channel supports a 
maximum of 64 TREs, which is insufficient to serve 32 or even 16 I2C 
messages concurrently, given the multiple TREs required per message.

To address this limitation, a strategy has been implemented to manage 
how many messages can be queued and how memory is recycled. The constant 
QCOM_I2C_GPI_MAX_NUM_MSGS is set to 16, defining the upper limit of
messages that can be queued at once. Additionally, 
QCOM_I2C_GPI_NUM_MSGS_PER_IRQ is set to 8, meaning that
half of the queued messages are expected to be freed or deallocated per 
interrupt.
This approach ensures that the driver can efficiently manage TRE 
resources and continue queuing new I2C messages without exhausting memory.

The I2C Geni driver is designed to prepare and submit descriptors to the 
GPI driver one message at a time.
As a result, the GPI driver does not have visibility into the current 
message index or the total number of I2C messages in a transfer. This 
lack of context makes it challenging to determine when to set the block 
event interrupt, which is typically used to signal the completion of a 
batch of messages.

So, the responsibility for deciding when to set the BEI should lie with 
the I2C driver.

If this approach is acceptable, I will proceed with updating the 
relevant details in the commit message.

Please let me know if you have any concerns or suggestions.
