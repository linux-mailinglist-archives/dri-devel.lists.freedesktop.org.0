Yes I know that, for example the HDMI audio stuff.

But *your implement* do rely on the DT, this is the point

Yes, you are right.

Nice,

What about the various clock, sir?

I have only one PCI device, let start from the simple case, OK?

I admire your fantastic idea.

let deal with it another patch in the future if such hardware emerged.

Accept the current implement, please ?

Yeah, but I notice that there is chipFeatures_DC defined in common.xml.h

I don't know how does this going to used, if a hardware marked it as true.
