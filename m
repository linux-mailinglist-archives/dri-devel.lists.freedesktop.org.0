I cannot reproduce it with my patch applied!  :(
Without the patch applied, I do see still see this.

I am now copying linux-doc, which I should have done to begin with.

@linux-doc: I am seeing the above (2) docs build errors, reportedlyfrom docutils (v0.22.2).

Rodrigo (DRM XE maintainer) cannot reproduce the docs build error.

Does anyone have any ideas about this?
[patch copied below] [also:

Subject: [PATCH] drm/xe: xe_guc_pc.c: fix DOC underlines

Apparently a recent change in docutils has made checking of section
heading levels (underline style) be more careful.

There are 2 heading underline style errors reported here. Repair them by
changing the underline style from Chapter (using '=') to Section (using
'-') since they are used within a Chapter already (in xe_firmware.rst).

Sorry for the resend. I didn't have .gitconfig present so parts of
