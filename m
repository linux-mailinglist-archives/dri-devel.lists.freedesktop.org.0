I'm not talking about bolting on a PCIe root complex, with its implicit
inherited "PCI is cache coherent" expectations to a ARM SoC, but just
the standard VPU/GPU/display engines are not snooping on most ARM SoCs.

Sure, all the non-coherent arches have some way to do the cache
maintenance in some explicit way. Non coherent and no cache maintenance
instruction would be a recipe for desaster. ;)

That's a very x86 centric world view you have there. 99% of DMA-buf
uses on those cheap ARM SoCs is non-snooping. We can not do any
fallbacks here, as the whole graphics world on those SoCs with their
different IP cores mixed together depends on DMA-buf sharing working
efficiently even when the SoC is mostly non coherent.

In fact DMA-buf sharing works fine on most of those SoCs because
everyone just assumes that all the accelerators don't snoop, so the
memory shared via DMA-buf is mostly CPU uncached. It only falls apart
for uses like the UVC cameras, where the shared buffer ends up being
CPU cached.

Non-coherent without explicit domain transfer points is just not going
to work. So why can't we solve the issue for DMA-buf in the same way as
the DMA API already solved it years ago: by adding the equivalent of
the dma_sync calls that do cache maintenance when necessary? On x86 (or
any system where things are mostly coherent) you could still no-op them
for the common case and only trigger cache cleaning if the importer
explicitly says that is going to do a non-snooping access.

Lucas
