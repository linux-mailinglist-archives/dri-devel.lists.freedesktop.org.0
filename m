--- Comment #41 from Rui Salvaterra <rsalvaterra@gmail.com> ---
Hi, guys

I haven't tried Marek's solution yet. It's the first time I build Mesa from
scratch and I've never used Meson before, so I'm studying along the way. I
applied the patch, configured with no DRI drivers and only the r300g driver,
compiled and installed to the default location
(/usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu, it seems). Unfortunately, glxinfo can't f=
ind
the libraries when I point the environment variables to them, so I must have
done something stupid. Will dig deeper.
(I know this isn't a developer support thread, I just wanted you to know I
haven't given up or stopped!)
