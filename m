For SLPC:

* We can't have the notion of software tracked cur_freq in rps because FW is
  managing the freq.
* rps->cur_freq /is/ actually 0 since SLPC does not use 'struct
  intel_rps'. So this patch doesn't really make any practical difference,
  PMU values will be exactly the same with or without this patch. It was
  just clarifying things.

I will drop this patch, there doesn't seem much point in it.

Thanks.
