We are seeking nominations for candidates for election to the X.Org
Foundation Board of Directors. All X.Org Foundation members are eligible
for election to the board.

Nominations for the 2023 election are now open and will remain open
until 23:59 UTC on 19 March 2023.

The Board consists of directors elected from the membership. Each year,
an election is held to bring the total number of directors to eight. The
four members receiving the highest vote totals will serve as directors
for two year terms.

The directors who received two year terms starting in 2022 were Emma
Anholt, Mark Filion, Alyssa Rosenzweig and Ricardo Garcia. They will
continue to serve until their term ends in 2024. Current directors whose
term expires in 2023 are Samuel Iglesias Gons=C3=A1lvez, Manasi D Navare,
Lyude Paul and Daniel Vetter.

A director is expected to participate in the fortnightly IRC meeting to
discuss current business and to attend the annual meeting of the X.Org
Foundation, which will be held at a location determined in advance by
the Board of Directors.

A member may nominate themselves or any other member they feel is
qualified. Nominations should be sent to the Election Committee at
elections at x.org.

Nominees shall be required to be current members of the X.Org
Foundation, and submit a personal statement of up to 200 words that will
be provided to prospective voters. The collected statements, along with
the statement of contribution to the X.Org Foundation in the member's
account page on http://members.x.org, will be made available to all
voters to help them make their voting decisions.

Nominations, membership applications or renewals and completed personal
statements must be received no later than 23:59 UTC on 19 March 2023.

The slate of candidates will be published 26 March 2023 and candidate
Q&A will begin then. The deadline for Xorg membership applications and
renewals is 26 March 2023.

Cheers,
Ricardo Garcia, on behalf of the X.Org BoD
