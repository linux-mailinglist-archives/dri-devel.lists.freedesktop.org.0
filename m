            Bug ID: 208893
           Summary: Navi (RX 5700 XT) system appears to hang with more
                    than one display connected
           Product: Drivers
           Version: 2.5
    Kernel Version: 5.8.1, 5.7.15
          Hardware: x86-64
                OS: Linux
              Tree: Mainline
            Status: NEW
          Severity: high
          Priority: P1
         Component: Video(DRI - non Intel)
          Assignee: drivers_video-dri@kernel-bugs.osdl.org
          Reporter: gordon@gordonite.tech
        Regression: No

I am using Fedora 32, and have tried the latest fixes with 5.8.1 mainline, and
stable Fedora 32.

If i connect a single monitor to my system it works fine.

However, when I connect a freesync monitor (144Hz and another 24 inch monitor,
the system during boot shows much larger startup times, and also general
hanging, the screen flickers too but ONLY when the second monitor is
connected.)

When I boot the system, even the 'booting' is delayed considerably by
comparison when the second display port monitor is connected.

It seems to be one of two problems:
- with multiple displays the card is not behaving properly
- the difference in refresh rates is causing a problem / conflict.

I do not know for certain where the problem lies, but even booting is slowing
down so I do not believe this is purely a Mesa issue.

Using wayland or xorg seems to make little difference the problem is on both,
and even on terminal sessions (slowing down terminal output to the display and
general unresponsiveness)

however as stated above, rebooting with a single display resolves these
problems.
