Since yesterday I also briefly tested with Far Cry New Dawn. One run 
each so possibly doesn't mean anything apart that there isn't a 
regression aka migration throttling is keeping things at bay even with 
increased requests to migrate things back to VRAM:
			
		     before		 after
min/avg/max fps	    36/44/54		37/45/55

Cyberpunk 2077 from yesterday was similarly close:

		26.96/29.59/30.40	29.70/30.00/30.32

I guess the real story is proper DGPU where misplaced buffers have a 
real cost.
