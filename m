Christian and me realized we have a pretty massive disconnect about
different interpretations of what dma_resv is used for by different
drivers. The discussion is much, much bigger than this change here,
but this is an important one:

Non-dynamic exporters must guarantee that the memory they return is
ready for use. They cannot expect importers to wait for the exclusive
fence. Only dynamic importers are required to obey the dma_resv fences
strictly (and more patches are needed to define exactly what this
means).

Christian has patches to update nouvea, radeon and amdgpu. The only
other driver using both ttm and supporting dma-buf export is qxl,
which only uses synchronous ttm_bo_move.

v2: To hammer this in document that dynamic importers _must_ wait for
the exclusive fence after having called dma_buf_map_attachment.
