Holding off for now because the 64 bit seqno flag needs a build fix. I 
have it locally but was waiting for more feedback on the series.

That one is for the fence object itself, right? Above I was specifically 
talking about the data pointed to from the fence such as the lock and 
and driver data accessible via the ops vfuncs.

It is still the same number 1) bullet point. Just clarifying that one 
does not need engineer for grace periods right after signalling.

Not sure exactly how that would work. Wouldn't it imply either 
GFP_ATOMIC or upgrading the RCU requirements to SRCU?
