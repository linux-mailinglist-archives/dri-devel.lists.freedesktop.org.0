I don't know the history there. But I am noticing Vulkan has at least four priorities.

First of all there is a "within process" priority which is expressed as [0.0f - 1.0f]. That does not seem to be implemented on the ANV side, which is perhaps understandable for now, since we don't have a scheduler smart enough to distinguish clients, its all just contexts regardless to which client they belong.

Then there is VK_EXT_global_priority which has four discrete levels (*). This one is implemented in ANV and maps to -512, 0, +512 and +1023 in i915 context priority uapi terms.

(*) Interesting fact is that despite four discrete levels, the Vulkan enum values are curiously spaced - as if they wanted to allow for more fine grained control in the future.

typedef enum VkQueueGlobalPriorityKHR {
     VK_QUEUE_GLOBAL_PRIORITY_LOW_KHR = 128,
     VK_QUEUE_GLOBAL_PRIORITY_MEDIUM_KHR = 256,
     VK_QUEUE_GLOBAL_PRIORITY_HIGH_KHR = 512,
     VK_QUEUE_GLOBAL_PRIORITY_REALTIME_KHR = 1024,
     VK_QUEUE_GLOBAL_PRIORITY_LOW_EXT = VK_QUEUE_GLOBAL_PRIORITY_LOW_KHR,
     VK_QUEUE_GLOBAL_PRIORITY_MEDIUM_EXT = VK_QUEUE_GLOBAL_PRIORITY_MEDIUM_KHR,
     VK_QUEUE_GLOBAL_PRIORITY_HIGH_EXT = VK_QUEUE_GLOBAL_PRIORITY_HIGH_KHR,
     VK_QUEUE_GLOBAL_PRIORITY_REALTIME_EXT = VK_QUEUE_GLOBAL_PRIORITY_REALTIME_KHR,
} VkQueueGlobalPriorityKHR;

AMD side seemed almost the same as i915, all until the point when I ended up in the kernel side amdgpu_to_sched_priority which does not seem called from anywhere. So not sure how those four actually map to amdgpu and drm/sched.

Christian are you reading this to help answer perhaps?

I lost you here - I don't think paradigms are different, nor that CPU nice is somehow tied with blocked on I/O.

There is a default inherit from CPU nice to I/O nice, but _only_ for default I/O priority - where it hasn't been explicitly set via respective system calls. Which is exactly what I am proposing for GPU.

Of course. Where it gets more complicated is when you have multiple userspace libraries processing the same data set in turn.

Exactly. And not only long running compute but high queue depth in general.

Consider for instance user working in say Handbrake - fires away a transcode in the background while continues to fiddle with previews for a next video. Background transcode can queue up multiple frames worth of work into the GPU, where each frame can be several milliseconds worth of GPU time. Even in this scenario you get into the context scheduling terrirory rather than intearctive bursty / vsynced workloads.

Not only that but to process a single frame we can have a buffer first be decoded on the GPU, processed on the CPU and then encoded on the GPU again. In the future a VPU block will appear in this chain as well. So you need a way to control priority of all components in the chain in an consistent and usable manner.

You can make all the libraries and applications aware of course.. but realistically that will be hard and fragile. What I propose is for an operation like "nice 5 ffmpeg-transcode.sh ..." to just work in the background for the complete pipeline, just as the user intended.

By this you mean you don't just feel the hw priority queues at will but make sure only a small amount of work is in each?

To deal with a varying cost of preemption is a matter of selecting the right timeslice. But yes, smart(er) scheduling is a somewhat orthogonal problem to priority control.
