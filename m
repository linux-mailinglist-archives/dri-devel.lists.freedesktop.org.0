drm_sched_backend_ops.timedout_job()'s documentation is outdated. It
mentions the deprecated function drm_sched_resubmit_job(). Furthermore,
it does not point out the important distinction between hardware and
firmware schedulers.

Since firmware schedulers tyipically only use one entity per scheduler,
timeout handling is significantly more simple because the entity the
faulted job came from can just be killed without affecting innocent
processes.

Update the documentation with that distinction and other details.

Reformat the docstring to work to a unified style with the other
handles.

+	 * 1. Stop all schedulers impacted by the reset using drm_sched_stop().
+	 * 2. Kill the entity the faulty job stems from.
+	 * 3. Issue a GPU reset on all faulty rings (driver-specific).
+	 * 4. Re-submit jobs on all schedulers impacted by re-submitting them to
+	 *    the entities which are still alive.
+	 * 5. Restart all schedulers that were stopped in step #1 using
+	 *    drm_sched_start().
 	 *
 	 * Note that some GPUs have distinct hardware queues but need to reset
 	 * the GPU globally, which requires extra synchronization between the
-	 * timeout handler of the different &drm_gpu_scheduler. One way to
-	 * achieve this synchronization is to create an ordered workqueue
-	 * (using alloc_ordered_workqueue()) at the driver level, and pass this
