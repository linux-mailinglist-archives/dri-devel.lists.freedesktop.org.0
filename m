Currently we expose the ability to retrieve an SGTable for an shmem gem
object using gem::shmem::Object::<T>::sg_table(). However, this only gives
us a borrowed reference. This being said - retrieving an SGTable is a
fallible operation, and as such it's reasonable that a driver may want to
hold onto an SGTable for longer then a reference would allow in order to
avoid having to deal with fallibility every time they want to access the
SGTable. One such driver with this usecase is the Asahi driver.

So to support this, let's introduce shmem::SGTable - which both holds a
pointer to the SGTable and a reference to its respective GEM object in
order to keep the GEM object alive for as long as the shmem::SGTable. The
type can be used identically to a normal SGTable.

V3:
* Rename OwnedSGTable to shmem::SGTable. Since the current version of the
  SGTable abstractions now has a `Owned` and `Borrowed` variant, I think
  renaming this to shmem::SGTable makes things less confusing.
  We do however, keep the name of owned_sg_table() as-is.
V4:
* Clarify safety comments for SGTable to explain why the object is
  thread-safe.
* Rename from SGTableRef to SGTable
