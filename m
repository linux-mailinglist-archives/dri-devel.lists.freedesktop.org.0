At this point with patch 3 applied it should switch to ring 0 right away
because of trigger call in the end of a5xx_preempt_irq. Didn't you
forget it? Downstream has such call too. Even though it makes preemption
a little more aggressive it doesn't work without it.

I don't think this is possible on modern CPUs. Could it be that retire
IRQ appeared earlier (while it was switching from 0 to 2) and you are
looking at msm_gpu_submit_retired trace event which is called from
retire work later.

In this patch series i have tried to do least amount of changes so it
could be easily back-ported. It isn't pretty but it works reliably for
me. Otherwise it would be fine to just disable preemption like it's done
on LTS before 5.4 and rework preemption in new kernel releases.

Kind regards,

Vladimir
