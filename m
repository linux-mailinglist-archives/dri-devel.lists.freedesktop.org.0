Ok, here's the most recent one that I tripped over, and the CVE
community hit as well (a CVE consumer reported the problem to me):
	a6dd15981c03 ("drm/amdgpu: prevent NULL pointer dereference if ATIF is not supported")
which showed up in the 6.12 release (6.12-rc6 to be specific), but yet
has the line:
	Fixes: c9b7c809b89f ("drm/amd: Guard against bad data for ATIF ACPI method")
while that commit was NOT in Linus's tree and did not get there until
6.13-rc1.

So here we have a commit that claims it fixes a commit that is not yet
in the tree.  This of course caused havoc with tools that assumed that
if a commit says it fixes something, that fix is in the tree already
(i.e. the CVE assignment scripts.)  After much digging around, it turns
out that the _REAL_ fixes commit id was:
	bf58f03931fd ("drm/amd: Guard against bad data for ATIF ACPI method")
which really showed up in 6.12-rc5 (and was backported to stable commits
as it too claimed to solve a problem in those kernels.)

So this is a real problem, and shows up and we have to then explain to
external people, "no, what that commit says really isn't true, it's
really fixing this other commit over there which is why we applied it
and why we had to manually mark this CVE as THAT commit being the
offending one, not this other one over there...)

So again, if you all wish to keep your current workflow, wonderful, but
realize it has consequences.  Those consequences are stable maintainers
that are loath to touch these patches, CVE maintainers who cringe every
time they see a DRM patch being assigned a CVE and hope that the tags
are correct and they don't have to manually research it to determine if
it is right or not (remember, we assign 8 CVEs a day, that workload does
not lend itself to hand-holding at all) and also there are confused
users when they try to determine where a fix should be applied to
because they want to not follow the stable kernels and do their own
thing (RHEL, SLES, ChromeOS, cloud-monstrosities, etc.)

I'm trying to point out "your workflow is causing problems."  If you
want to ignore that statement, fine.  But that doesn't mean it's not a
valid statement.
