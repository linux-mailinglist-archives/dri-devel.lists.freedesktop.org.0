[ Upstream commit f681c2aa8676a890eacc84044717ab0fd26e058f ]

put_unused_fd() doesn't free the installed file, if we've already done
fd_install().  So we need to also free the sync_file.

Based on my analysis, **YES**, this commit should be backported to
stable kernel trees.

## Extensive Explanation:

This commit fixes a **resource leak** in the MSM DRM driver's submit
error path, which is a clear bug that affects users and meets the stable
tree criteria.

### The Bug:

Looking at the code changes in `msm_gem_submit.c`:

1. **Before the fix**: When an error occurs after `fd_install()` has
   been called (line 865 in the context), the error path only calls
   `put_unused_fd(out_fence_fd)` at line 895-896.

2. **The problem**: As noted in the commit message, `put_unused_fd()`
   doesn't free the installed file if `fd_install()` has already been
   executed. The `sync_file` structure created by `sync_file_create()`
   (line 861) contains a file reference that needs to be released with
   `fput()`.

3. **The fix**: The patch adds proper cleanup by:
   - Moving `sync_file` declaration to function scope (line 661)
   - Adding proper cleanup in the error path (lines 895-898) that calls
     both `put_unused_fd()` AND `fput(sync_file->file)` when needed

### Why This Is a Good Backport Candidate:

1. **Clear Bug Fix**: This fixes a resource leak that can accumulate
   over time as applications hit error conditions during fence
   submission.

2. **Small and Contained**: The fix is minimal - just 5 lines of actual
   code changes that properly clean up resources.

3. **No Architectural Changes**: This doesn't introduce new features or
   change any APIs - it simply fixes error handling.

4. **Similar to Previous Backported Fixes**: Looking at similar commit
   #3 ("drm/msm: Fix submit error-path leaks") which was marked for
   backporting, this follows the same pattern of fixing resource leaks
   in error paths.

5. **Low Risk**: The change only affects error paths and adds proper
   cleanup that was missing. It cannot break the normal success path.

6. **Documentation Confirms**: The sync_file.c documentation (line
   62-63) explicitly states that sync_files should be released with
   `fput(sync_file->file)`, confirming this is the correct fix.

### Pattern Analysis:

Comparing with the similar commits provided:
- Similar commits #1, #2, and #4 were NOT backported (they were general
  code improvements or non-critical changes)
- Similar commits #3 and #5 WERE backported (they fixed actual resource
  leaks or initialization failures)

This commit clearly falls into the same category as #3 and #5 - fixing
an actual resource leak that can impact system stability over time.

The leak occurs whenever:
1. A sync_file is successfully created
2. fd_install() succeeds
3. But then a subsequent error occurs before the submit completes

Without this fix, each occurrence leaks a file descriptor and associated
kernel memory, which could eventually exhaust resources in systems with
heavy GPU usage that encounter errors.
