Hi all,

This patch set is a continuation of my previous work, which aimed
to add Energy Model to all devices. This series is a follow up
for the patches which got merged to v5.9-rc1. It aims to change
the thermal devfreq cooling and use the Energy Model instead of
private power table and structures. The new registration interface
in the patch 3/5 helps to register devfreq cooling and the EM in one
call. There is also another improvement, patch 2/5 is changing the
way how thermal gets the device status. Now it's taken on demand
and stored as a copy. The last patch wouldn't go through thermal tree,
but it's here for consistency.

The patch set is based on current next-20201118, which has new EM API
in the pm/linux-next tree.

changes:
v2:
- renamed freq_get_state() and related to perf_idx pattern as
  suggested by Ionela
v1 [2]

Lukasz Luba
