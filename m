Yes, I was entertaining similar thoughts for quite a while as well.

I think KERNEL fits better than the suggestions because that is really 
something only the kernel should use and we should not encourage anybody 
to use that for userspace submissions.

But using BOOKKEEP instead of OTHER sounds like a really good idea to 
me. Going to keep that in mind and if nobody has any better idea making 
the change for the next revision.

Thanks,
Christian.
