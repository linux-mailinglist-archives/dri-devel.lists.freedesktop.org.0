Hi All,

Here is v3 of my patch series converting the i915 driver's code for
controlling the panel's backlight with an external PWM controller to
use the atomic PWM API. See below for the changelog.

Initially the plan was for this series to consist of 2 parts:
1. convert the pwm-crc driver to support the atomic PWM API and
2. convert the i915 driver's PWM code to use the atomic PWM API.

But during testing I've found a number of bugs in the pwm-lpss and I
found that the acpi_lpss code needs some special handling because of
some ugliness found in most Cherry Trail DSDTs.

So now this series has grown somewhat large and consists of 4 parts:

1. acpi_lpss fixes workarounds for Cherry Trail DSTD nastiness
2. various fixes to the pwm-lpss driver
3. convert the pwm-crc driver to support the atomic PWM API and
4. convert the i915 driver's PWM code to use the atomic PWM API

So we need to discuss how to merge this (once it passes review).
Although the inter-dependencies are only runtime I still think we should
make sure that 1-3 are in the drm-intel-next-queued (dinq) tree before
merging the i915 changes. Both to make sure that the intel-gfx CI system
does not become unhappy and for bisecting reasons.

The involved acpi_lpss and pwm drivers do not see a whole lot of churn, so
it likely is the easiest to just merge everything through dinq.

Rafael and Thierry, can I get your Acked-by for directly merging this into
dinq?

This series has been tested (and re-tested after adding various bug-fixes)
extensively. It has been tested on the following devices:

-Asus T100TA  BYT + CRC-PMIC PWM
-Toshiba WT8-A  BYT + CRC-PMIC PWM
-Thundersoft TS178 BYT + CRC-PMIC PWM, inverse PWM
-Asus T100HA  CHT + CRC-PMIC PWM
-Terra Pad 1061  BYT + LPSS PWM
-Trekstor Twin 10.1 BYT + LPSS PWM
-Asus T101HA  CHT + CRC-PMIC PWM
-GPD Pocket  CHT + CRC-PMIC PWM

Changelog:

Changes in v2:
- Fix coverletter subject
- Drop accidentally included debugging patch
- "[PATCH v3 02/15] ACPI / LPSS: Save Cherry Trail PWM ctx registers only once (
  - Move #define LPSS_SAVE_CTX_ONCE define to group it with LPSS_SAVE_CTX

Changes in v3:
- "[PATCH v3 04/15] pwm: lpss: Add range limit check for the base_unit register value"
  - Use base_unit_range - 1 as maximum value for the clamp()
- "[PATCH v3 05/15] pwm: lpss: Use pwm_lpss_apply() when restoring state on resume"
  - This replaces the "pwm: lpss: Set SW_UPDATE bit when enabling the PWM"
    patch from previous versions of this patch-set, which really was a hack
    working around the resume issue which this patch fixes properly.
- PATCH v3 6 - 11 pwm-crc changes:
  - Various small changes resulting from the reviews by Andy and Uwe,
    including some refactoring of the patches to reduce the amount of churn
    in the patch-set

Regards,

Hans
