--- Comment #18 from Marco (rodomar705@protonmail.com) ---
As of 5.8.7 I've tried to revert to stock clocks, and I had no black screen
issue under load even after long game sessions.

It does *seems* to be fixed, at least for me.

I don't know how much code is shared between the Linux open source driver and
the Windows closed source driver, but I wonder if it was some bug that jumped
over the Windows driver too (or even if it was firmware related).

I'll keep testing to see if it happens again, but I haven't seen any error logs
mentioning amdgpu in the dmesg kernel.
