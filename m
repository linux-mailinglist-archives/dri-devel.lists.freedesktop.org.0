I see that in mainline as of 5.8-rc4 which I just triggered this bug on, so no,
that doesn't fix it.


As for the bisect, now that I'm down to just a few commits, I woke up a couple
hours ago with the idea to just try patch-reverting them on top of 5.7 or
current 5.8-rc, thus eliminating the apparently unrelated kernel-panics I''ve
twice triggered at the current bisect step. I delayed that to try this patch,
to no avail, but that's what I'm going to try now (which is after all
pre-5.6-rc1 so other bugs are to be expected).  For all I know some of the
reverts won't apply to current due to either being already reverted or more
code changes since, but we'll see how it goes.
