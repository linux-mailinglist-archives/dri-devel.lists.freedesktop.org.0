--- Comment #16 from Lyude Paul (lyude@redhat.com) ---
(In reply to Maurice Gale from comment #15)

Cool-so we at least should be able to trace the nvidia blob to figure out
what's going on. Do you think you could grab an mmiotrace of the nvidia blob
with all of your displays hooked up?

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/MMIOTracing

You might also need to add:

iomem=relaxed

To get that working. fwiw as well, that guide says somewhere to stop X
afterwards before stopping the trace. That may or may not work, and it should
be fine if you just leave X running when stopping the trace instead.

For submitting the mmiotrace to me, it's probably going to be somewhat large so
I would recommend compressing it with xz and just sending it directly to my
email.
