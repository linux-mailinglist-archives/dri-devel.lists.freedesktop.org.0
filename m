--- Comment #33 from Richard Thier <u9vata@gmail.com> ---
I have compiled a "how to build" just for you - linking sources I used:

http://ballmerpeak.web.elte.hu/devblog/building-your-own-mesa.html

Everyone should be able to try the quickfix using this and the links on this
page, but I guess even if questions arise there will be people answering th=
em -
just please do not clutter the bug report with these anymore. Write emails =
or
ask around forums or something as this is a general topic unrelated to the
slowdown bug.

Wondering about two things now:

- Is my quickfix patch working for other people too?
- Is my quickfix good-enough or should we dig deeper and solve the domain b=
its
issue other ways? (latter is a question towards more experiences devs)
