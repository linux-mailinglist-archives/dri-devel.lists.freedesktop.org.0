But why the drm_bridge_connector helpers and/or the drm_connector bridge can't suit you need?
Coding this way just add boilerplate into drm bridge subsystem, right?


The code path of "creating a connector" plus the code path of "not creating a connector"
forms a 'side-by-side' implementation imo.

Besides, I have repeated many times: the DT already speak everything.
Device drivers can completely know if there is a display connector OF device created and how many
display bridges in the whole chain. If there are connector device node in the DT, then it should
has a device driver bound to it(instead of create it manually) for a perfect implementation. As
you told me we should not *over play* the device-driver model, right?
