Yes, that commit comment said,Â  "It was proposed to add the displayport OF property to the DT bindings, but it was rejected in favor of properly describing the electrical signal path using of_graph."

But in the embedded case, we don't seem to have the opportunity to describe this kind of of_graph relationship between drm connector and usb connector in usb-connector.yaml. On the Qualcomm platform, the DRM connector fwnode to correspond to the USB-C controller, which is a clean solution.

However, on our platform we are using external USB-C controllers. In v4 and the previous versions, I focused on directly linking the USB-C controller with the DP controller. Referring to your suggest in [0], I think maybe this can be achieved with the help of the drm bridge chain. Assuming the bridge chain is like this:


Other birdges ... ->PHY drm aux hpd bridge -> CDN-DP bridge -> DP to HDMI bridge or other bridge or nothing...


We can use drm_bridge_chain_get_first_bridge() to get first bridge. In this case, that is drm aux hpd bridge from USB-C controller device. Next, we can obtain the fwnode corresponding to this bridge, and once we have it, we can set the connector's fwnode to it. In this way, drm_connector_oob_hotplug_event() can take effect.


Would this be a good idea? Thanks.
