Hi all,

This is a repost with some fixes and cleanups.

I'd really like to land this into drm-next, Maarten posted xe support for t=
his and some other work
and I think we need to start moving this forward in tree as I'm not sure wh=
at else I can really do
out of tree.

Differences since last posting:
1. Squashed exports into where they are used (Shakeel)
2. Fixed bug in uncharge path memcg
3. Fixed config bug in the module option.

Differences since 1st posting:
1. Added patch 18: add a module option to allow pooled pages to not be stor=
ed in the lru per-memcg
   (Requested by Christian Konig)
2. Converged the naming and stats between vmstat and memcg (Suggested by Sh=
akeel Butt)
3. Cleaned up the charge/uncharge code and some other bits.

Dave.

Original cover letter:
tl;dr: start using list_lru/numa/memcg in GPU driver core and amdgpu driver=
 for now.

This is a complete series of patches, some of which have been sent before a=
nd reviewed,
but I want to get the complete picture for others, and try to figure out ho=
w best to land this.

There are 3 pieces to this:
01->02: add support for global gpu stat counters (previously posted, patch =
2 is newer)
03->06: port ttm pools to list_lru for numa awareness
07->13: add memcg stats + gpu apis, then port ttm pools to memcg aware list=
_lru and shrinker
14: enable amdgpu to use new functionality.
15: add a module option to turn it all off.

The biggest difference in the memcg code from previously is I discovered wh=
at
obj cgroups were designed for and I'm reusing the page/objcg intergration t=
hat=20
already exists, to avoid reinventing that wheel right now.

There are some igt-gpu-tools tests I've written at:
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/airlied/igt-gpu-tools/-/tree/amdgpu-cgroups?=
ref_type=3Dheads

One problem is there are a lot of delayed action, that probably means the t=
esting
needs a bit more robustness, but the tests validate all the basic paths.

Regards,
Dave.
