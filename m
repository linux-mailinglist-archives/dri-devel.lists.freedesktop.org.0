--- Comment #41 from Duncan (1i5t5.duncan@cox.net) ---
(In reply to Alex Deucher from comment #40)
> Does this patch help?

Booted to v5.7 with it applied now.  We'll see.  Since the bug can take awhile
to trigger on my hardware, if the patch fixes it I won't know for days, and
won't be /sure/ for say  a week, the reason bisecting was taking so long.

(It wouldn't apply to current 5.8-rc4-plus-an-s390-pull.  Too tired to figure
out why ATM but if it's because it was there already, hopefully it was pulled
in after v5.8-rc3 as I tested that and got the same graphics freeze with the
characteristic trace, so if the patch was already in v5.8-rc3, it does /not/
fix the bug.)

As for bisecting, I've hard-crashed twice on the current step, apparently with
a different bug, so while _this_ bug hasn't seemed to trigger yet, I haven't
gotten the necessary confidence that it's a bisect-good.  So hopefully this
patch /does/ fix it, and I can put this entirely too frustrating bug-bisect
behind me!
