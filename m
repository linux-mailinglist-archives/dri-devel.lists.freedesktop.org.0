Thanks for your review.  

I had considered moving the entire `hvfb_putmem()` function to `destroy`,
but I was hesitant for two reasons:  

  1. I wasnâ€™t aware of any scenario where this would be useful. However,
     your explanation has convinced me that it is necessary.  
  2. `hvfb_release_phymem()` relies on the `hdev` pointer, which requires
     multiple `container_of` operations to derive it from the `info` pointer.
     I was unsure if the complexity was justified, but it seems worthwhile now.  

I will move `hvfb_putmem()` to the `destroy` function in V2, and I hope this
will address all the cases you mentioned.
