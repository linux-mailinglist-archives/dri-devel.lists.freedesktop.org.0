Possible?  I think so, but maybe Alex can comment on this after the 
holidays as he's more familiar.

It would mean splitting and introducing an entirely new phase to driver 
initialization.  The information about the discovery table comes from VRAM.

amdgpu_driver_load_kms -> amdgpu_device_init -> amdgpu_device_ip_early_init

Basically that code specific would have to call earlier and then there 
would need to be a separate set of code for all the IP blocks to *just* 
collect what firmware they need.

Running on this idea I'm pretty sure that request_firmware returns 
-ENOENT in this case. So another proposal for when to trigger this flow 
would be to only do it on -ENOENT.  We could then also change 
amdgpu_discovery.c to return -ENOENT when an IP block isn't supported 
instead of the current -EINVAL.

Or we could instead co-opt -ENOTSUPP and remap all the cases that we 
explicitly want the system framebuffer to re-initialize to that.
