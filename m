Subject: backlight/bd6107: Compare against struct fb_info.device

From: Thomas Zimmermann <tzimmermann@suse.de>

commit 992bdddaabfba19bdc77c1c7a4977b2aa41ec891 upstream.

Struct bd6107_platform_data refers to a platform device within
the Linux device hierarchy. The test in bd6107_backlight_check_fb()
compares it against the fbdev device in struct fb_info.dev, which
is different. Fix the test by comparing to struct fb_info.device.

Fixes a bug in the backlight driver and prepares fbdev for making
struct fb_info.dev optional.

v2:
	* move renames into separate patch (Javier, Sam, Michael)

Fixes: 67b43e590415 ("backlight: Add ROHM BD6107 backlight driver")
