I'm talking about aligning DRM locks with the dma-buf locks. The problem
is that the convention of dma-bufs isn't specified yet. In particular
there is no convention for the mapping operations.

If we want to switch vmapping of shmem to use reservation lock, then
somebody will have to hold this lock for dma_buf_vmap() and the locking
convention needs to be specified firmly.

In case of dynamic buffers, we will also need to specify whether
dma_buf_vmap() should imply the implicit pinning by exporter or the
buffer must be pinned explicitly by importer before dma_buf_vmap() is
invoked.

Perhaps I indeed shouldn't care about this for this patchset. The
complete locking model of dma-bufs must be specified first.

Those drivers that die don't have userspace that uses dma-bufs
extensively. I noticed it only because was looking at this code too much
for the last days.

Drivers that don't die either map imported BOs properly or don't allow
mapping at all.

The reservation lock itself doesn't help much shmem, IMO. It should help
only in the context of dynamic dma-bufs and today we don't have a need
in the dynamic shmem dma-bufs.

You were talking about making DRM locks consistent with dma-buf locks,
so I thought that yours main point of making use of reservation locks
for shmem is to prepare to the new locking scheme.

I wanted to try to specify the dma-buf locking convention for mapping
operations because it's missing right now and it should affect how DRM
should take the reservation locks, but this is not easy to do as I see now.

Could you please point at the Christian's RFC patch? He posted too many
patches, can't find it :) I'm curious to take a look.
