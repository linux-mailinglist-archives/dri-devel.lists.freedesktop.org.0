Yes I think I was getting myself confused - for some reason I'd thought
the ring buffers in each queue were the same size. It makes sense to
keep this.

I wouldn't say I have a strong opinion, it just seems a little odd to be
multiplying the value by a constant everywhere. If you'd got some
changes planned where the instructions could vary more dynamically that
would be good to know about.

If Boris is "keener" on this approach then that's fine, we'll leave it
this way.
