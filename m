We are seeking nominations for candidates for election to the X.Org 
Foundation Board of Directors. All X.Org Foundation members are eligible 
for election to the board.

Nominations for the 2024 election are now open and will remain open 
until 23:59 UTC on 26 February 2024.

The Board consists of directors elected from the membership. Each year, 
an election is held to bring the total number of directors to eight. The 
four members receiving the highest vote totals will serve as directors 
for two year terms.

The directors who received two year terms starting in 2023 were 
Arkadiusz Hiler, Christopher Michael, Lyude Paul, and Daniel Vetter. 
They will continue to serve until their term ends in 2024. Current 
directors whose term expires in 2024 are Emma Anholt, Mark Filion, 
Ricardo Garcia, and Alyssa Rosenzweig.
<https://rosenzweig.io/>

A director is expected to participate in the fortnightly IRC meeting to 
discuss current business and to attend the annual meeting of the X.Org 
Foundation, which will be held at a location determined in advance by 
the Board of Directors.

A member may nominate themselves or any other member they feel is 
qualified. Nominations should be sent to the Election Committee at 
elections@x.org.

Nominees shall be required to be current members of the X.Org 
Foundation, and submit a personal statement of up to 200 words that will 
be provided to prospective voters. The collected statements, along with 
the statement of contribution to the X.Org Foundation in the member's 
account page on http://members.x.org, will be made available to all 
voters to help them make their voting decisions.

Nominations, membership applications or renewals and completed personal 
statements must be received no later than 23:59 UTC on 26 February 2024.

The slate of candidates will be published 04 March 2024 and candidate 
Q&A will begin then. The deadline for Xorg membership applications and 
renewals is 07 March 2024.


Cheers,

Christopher Michael, on behalf of the X.Org BoD
