I think this series collected quite a few TODOs to follow up on once the
corresponding abstractions are in place, etc. This is fine and expected.

However, I think we should list those things in a central place, e.g. our TODO
list, in order to make it easier to follow up.

Additionally, it might get us more contributors who might be interested in
following up on those things.

@Alex: Can you please add such a list?
