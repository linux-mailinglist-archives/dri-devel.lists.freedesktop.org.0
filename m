Like Geert I wondered about this statement, since you need to change the
DT to use such a display. But if you count overlays as not changing the
DT, ok.

Really good writeup of the situation Maxime!

I really like this idea. An added benefit is that one driver can handle
all MIPI DBI compatible controllers avoiding the need to do a patchset
like this for all the various MIPI DBI controllers. The firmware will
just contain numeric commands with parameters, so no need for different
controller drivers to handle the controller specific command names.

The following is a list of the MIPI DBI compatible controllers currently
in staging/fbtft: ili9341, hx8357d, st7735r, ili9163, ili9163, ili9163,
ili9163, ili9486, ili9481, tinylcd, s6d02a1, s6d02a1, hx8340bn, ili9340.

The compatible needs to be a bit more specific though since there are 2
major SPI protocols for these display: MIPI DBI and the one used by
ILI9325 and others.

The full binding would be something like this:

panel@42 {
	compatible = "panel-mipi-dbi-spi";
	model = "panel-from-random-place-42";

	/* The MIPI DBI spec lists these powers supply pins */
	vdd-supply = <&...>;
	vddi-supply = <&...>;

	/* Optional gpio to drive the RESX line */
	reset-gpios = <&...>;

	/*
	 * D/CX: Data/Command, Command is active low
	 * Abcense: Interface option 1 (D/C embedded in 9-bit word)
	 * Precense: Interface option 3
	 */
	dc-gpios = <&...>;

	/*
	 * If set the driver won't try to read from the controller to see
	 * if it's already configured by the bootloader or previously by
	 * the driver. A readable controller avoids flicker and/or delay
	 * enabling the pipeline.
	 *
	 * This property might not be necessary if we are guaranteed to
	 * always read back all 1's or 0's when MISO is not connected.
	 * I don't know if all setups can guarantee that.
	 */
	write-only;

	/* Optional ref to backlight node */
	backlight = <&...>;
}

Many of these controllers also have a RGB interface option for the
pixels and only do configuration over SPI.
Maybe the compatible should reflect these 2 options somehow?

Noralf.
