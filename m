Yeah, both is possible, I'm fine with either.

The benefit is that this way it becomes an official API, which can (and must)
be considered should there ever be a change on drm_file::client_id.

If someone would patch drm_file::client_id to start allocating IDs from high to
low, your corresponding driver code would silently break, because it relies on
an implementation detail of something that is not an official API.

Yes, I know that this exact case won't happen, but I guess you get the idea. :-)
