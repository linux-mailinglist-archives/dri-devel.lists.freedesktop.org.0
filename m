I think that the only thing that we might see at some point in the future is one
power domain per "set of shader cores", but not even sure that's really going to
ever be a thing, as it might just not be worth implementing from a firmware
perspective.

I am guessing here - we won't ever see one power domain per core.

Besides, also remember that many GPUs do have internal power management (as in,
per-core or per-core-set shutdown) so there already is such a power saving way.
That makes a vendor-specific implementation of that way less likely to see, even
though.. being cautious, never say never.

In any case, we can't predict the future, we can only guess - and evaluate things
that could or could not realistically make sense.

(anyway if you find a magic ball, please share, I need it for some other stuff :P)

That's a bit too much pessimistic... I hope.

I had no doubt that you were thinking alike, but happy to see that confirmed.

I'm not sure. A power controller being also a clock provider isn't entirely
uncommon (look at i.MX8 MP), but then think about it: if you add a MFD, you
are still introducing vendor APIs around... as you'd need a way to do your
piece of communication with the EB.

The benefit, then, is only what you just said.

There are literally too many alternatives to do the very same as what you're
doing here, including having a (firmware|soc)/mediatek-gpueb.c driver managing
only the communication part, and the rest all in small different drivers, or...

...you could share the reserved-memory between the two drivers, and have the efuse
driver getting a power domain from mtk-mfg-pmdomain (to check and call mfg power
on), then reading the byte(s) that you need from GF_REG_SHADER_PRESENT from there.

Not sure then what's the best option.

One thing I'm sure about is that you're setting how everything works *now*, and
changing that later is going to cause lots of pain and lots of suffering, so a
decision must be taken right now.
