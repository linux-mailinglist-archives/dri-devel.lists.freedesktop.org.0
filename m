--- Comment #72 from MasterCATZ (mastercatz@hotmail.com) ---
finally this summer the R9 290 GPU's will be manageable 

seems to be working , now I just have to find the old settings I changed when
trying to run it at higher rpm , @ 60deg and its doing 80%+ RPM
possibly it is now following my BIOS settings from when I was trying to force
higher RPM  when it kept trying to run under 20% 

my manual settings seem to get overwritten a second after setting them 
but at least I am not being locked out like before 


now if someone could solve the issue when it uses more power when running
multiple displays ( exactly the same monitors res / hz  )
 I can run the card single display under 10 watts plug in another display and
its over 50 watts idle
