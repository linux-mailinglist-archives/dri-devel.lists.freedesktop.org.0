Your reasons are totally valid and I see the point.

That's what I'll do as a follow-up Fixes patch:
  - gpu_write(pfdev, GPU_INT_MASK, 0);
  - gpu_write(pfdev, GPU_INT_CLEAR, GPU_IRQ_MASK_ALL);
  - synchronize_irq()
  - poweroff *all* shaders/tilers/l2 (without caring about core_mask)
  - *No* INT_MASK restore, as we rely on soft_reset() to do that for us
    once we resume the GPU.

Yes, I am well aware of that and I was trying to make that clear in the first
place - I'm sorry if I gave the impression of having any kind of doubt around
that, or any other.
