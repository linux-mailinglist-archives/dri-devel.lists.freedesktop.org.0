Hi Thomas.

Sorry for chiming in late here, have been offline for a while.

The whole idea with a struct that can represent both a pointer to system
memory and io memory is very nice.
dma-buf is one user of this but we may/will see other users. So the
naming seems of as this should be a concept independent of dma-buf.

And then the struct definition and all the helpers should be moved away
from dma-buf.

Maybe something like this:

struct simap {
       union {
               void __iomem *vaddr_iomem;
               void *vaddr;
       };
       bool is_iomem;
};

Where simap is a shorthand for system_iomem_map
And it could al be stuffed into a include/linux/simap.h file.

Not totally sold on the simap name - but wanted to come up with
something.

With this approach users do not have to pull in dma-buf to use it and
users will not confuse that this is only for dma-buf usage.

I am sorry for being late with the feedback.

	Sam
