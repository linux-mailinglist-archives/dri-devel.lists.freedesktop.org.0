FWIW, the fix landed now as 1b9b4f922f96 ; sadly without a Link: tag to
the report, hence I have to mark this manually as resolved:

#regzbot fix: 1b9b4f922f96108da3bb5d87b2d603f5dfbc5650

FWIW, nope, that's not enough you have to tag those explicitly to ensure
backporting, as explained in
Documentation/process/stable-kernel-rules.rst Greg points that out every
few weeks, recently here for example:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/Y6BWPo9S9QbnsAx6@kroah.com/
