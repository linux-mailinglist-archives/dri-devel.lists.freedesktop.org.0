Here, 3) will also become async, awaiting any pending unbinds in the 
address range provided to 3), in particular, the bind in 3) will await 
4). See i915_vma_resource_bind_dep_await(), and the discussion on 
whether or not to use an interval tree for this at the start of 
i915_vma_resource.c

> I agree that if pages - vma - virtual gpu range is not 1:1:1 mapping, we need introduce a finer-grained vma resource to for the non-1:1 mapping. I also understand the asynchronous unbinding utilize the virtual address space more effectively. But my feeling is that this non-1:1 mapping makes our program hard to understand and maintain. Since this non- 1:1 mapping is introduced by asynchronous binding/unbinding, maybe the real question here is, is it really benefit to introduce asynchronous unbinding?

That's a relevant question, which I've asked myself a couple of times. 
Async unbinding has complicated things like error capture and indeed 
complicates the understanding of the binding process as well.

The main gain is that we avoid a sync point at LMEM eviction, enabling 
us to pipeline eviction, moving forward it may also find use in the 
shrinker and for user-space prematurely wanting to re-use softpin addresses.
