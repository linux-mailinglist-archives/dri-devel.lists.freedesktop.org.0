--- Comment #9 from Robert M. Muncrief (rmuncrief@humanavance.com) ---
The same type of problem also occurred when I had my old R9-390 and GT 710
GPUs, FX-6300 CPU, and Gigabyte GA-990FXA-UD5 motherboard. However if I put the
GT 710 in the primary PCIE slot the resume problem never occurred.

I can't be certain it was the exact same problem though, because there were a
lot of AMDGPU resume problems and I just assumed it was because the hardware I
had was so old. And since my R9 390 AMDGPU support was considered experimental
I figured I had to live with the issue.

So I really hoped it would go away when I got my two new RX 580 GPUs, R7 3700X
CPU, and X570 motherboard, but unfortunately the resume problem still occurs.
And I gave away my GT 710 so I can't check to see if it still alleviates the
issue.
