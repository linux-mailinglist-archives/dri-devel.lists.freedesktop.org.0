The child option could potentially be an option here, as it would make
some sense, at least for me - since the child pwrseq DT node would
describe part of the AON block.

Sure - this can be done using existing AON node.

To keep the pwrseq code organized in drivers/power/sequencing/, a
similar approach to our th1520-pd driver interfacing with the AON
firmware library (drivers/firmware/thead,th1520-aon.c) could work.

The idea would be to treat code like pwrseq-thead-aon.c (changed from a
current pwrseq-thead-gpu.c) as a library. It would export its necessary
functions (e.g., for specific sequence init/deinit steps) using
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL. The main AON driver would then call these to provide
the pwrseq functionality.

This will introduce a compile-time dependency, as expected.

An alternative would be to keep the driver in drivers/power/sequencing/
as a platform driver and start it up using, for example, an auxiliary
bus. This is similar to what the JH7110 clock driver
(drivers/clk/starfive/clk-starfive-jh7110-sys.c) is doing with a reset
driver. This could offer a cleaner separation of roles if that's
preferred.

Please let me know which way would be preferred.
