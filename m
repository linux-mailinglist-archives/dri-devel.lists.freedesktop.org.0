--- Comment #38 from Richard Thier <u9vata@gmail.com> ---
Hello everyone!

While hopefully someone is testing Marek's solution as I went to test if the
"minor problem" between 04ea03d99d8 and 19.x is causing a slowdown or not.

Despite most of the heavy slowdown went away now, I am still unsure if the =
more
ioctl calls in later versions (let's call it ioctl spamming) can cause a
slowdown in cases or not so I plan to compare performance of more heavy gam=
es
between a patched 19.x and the last working 17.x just to see how it is and
maybe start bisecting from 04ea03d99d8 if there is still a slowdown.

It just bugs me as a bad feeling so I want to be sure with heavier games th=
an
extreme tux racer...
