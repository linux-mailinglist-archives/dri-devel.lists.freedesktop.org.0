Would you like to tell us what's the 'board file'?

I am asking because I can not understand those two words at all.
I'm really don't know what's the meanings of 'board file'.

Do you means that board file is something like the dts, or
somethings describe the stuff on the motherboard but outside
the CPU?

Does the hardware IP core belong to the "board file"?

Can we using more concrete vocabulary instead of the vague
vocabulary to communicate?
