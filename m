I don't see how this is specific to Nvidia or DRM drivers.

The efifb is killed if vfio-pci (or another driver which uses the
aperture system to remove conflicting drivers) is bound to ANY pci
device, regardless of whether it's nvidia's fault for not implementing
a framebuffer. Fair enough, I agree that they should, but
I for one expect my efifb to not die at a random time
when a random unrelated driver does a random thing with another
unrelated GPU.

Or is the efifb considered a stop-gap solution the only purpose of
which is early boot--before another GPU driver is loaded?
