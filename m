 From my experience the most common design pattern in the Linux kernel 
is that you either have reference counted objects which contain a 
private pointer (like struct file, struct inode etc..) or the lifetime 
is defined by the user of the object instead of reference counting and 
in this case you can embed it into your own object.

I have to agree with Danilo here. Especially you have cases where you 
usually lock BO->VM (for example eviction) as well as cases where you 
need to lock VM->BO (command submission).

Because of this in amdgpu we used (or abused?) the dma_resv of the root 
BO as lock for the VM. Since this is a ww_mutex locking it in both VM, 
BO as well as BO, VM order works.

Christian.
