It also seems wrong to implement the WMI plumbing in the ACPI video driver, and export it so that the EC backlight driver can use it, so I guess I can live with the duplication of the relatively simple WMI stuff here, it would just be nice to not have to define all of the API constants, structure, and GUID twice.

I have no real preference. Whatever is easiest for you.
