It seems my initial suspicion that at least some of these regressions
were related to the runtime PM work was correct. The hard resets happens
when the DP controller is runtime suspended after being probed:

  < machine is reset by hypervisor >

Presumably the reset happens when controller is being shut down while
still being used by the EFI framebuffer.

In the cases where the machines survives boot, the controller is never
suspended.

When investigating this I've also seen intermittent:

	[drm:dp_display_probe [msm]] *ERROR* device tree parsing failed

which also appears to be related to the runtime PM rework:

	https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1701472789-25951-1-git-send-email-quic_khsieh@quicinc.com/

I believe this is enough evidence to conclude that this second
regression is introduced by commit 5814b8bf086a ("drm/msm/dp:
incorporate pm_runtime framework into DP driver"):

#regzbot introduced: 5814b8bf086a

Has anyone given some thought to how the framebuffer handover is
supposed to work? It seems we're currently just relying on luck with
timing.

Johan
