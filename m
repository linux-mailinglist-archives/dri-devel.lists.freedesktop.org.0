dma_fence is a synchronization mechanism which is needed by virtually
all GPU drivers.

A dma_fence offers many features, among which the most important ones
are registering callbacks (for example to kick off a work item) which
get executed once a fence gets signalled.

dma_fence has a number of callbacks. Only the two most basic ones
(get_driver_name(), get_timeline_name() are abstracted since they are
enough to enable the basic functionality.

Callbacks in Rust are registered by passing driver data which implements
the Rust callback trait, whose function will be called by the C backend.

dma_fence's are always refcounted, so implement AlwaysRefcounted for
them. Once a reference drops to zero, the C backend calls a release
function, where we implement drop_in_place() to conveniently marry that
C-cleanup mechanism with Rust's ownership concepts.

This patch provides basic functionality, but is still missing:
  - An implementation of PinInit<T, Error> for all driver data.
  - A clever implementation for working dma_fence_begin_signalling()
    guards. See the corresponding TODO in the code.
  - Additional useful helper functions such as dma_fence_is_signaled().
    These _should_ be relatively trivial to implement, though.

So. Â¡Hola!

This is a highly WIP RFC. It's obviously at many places not yet
conforming very well to Rust's standards.

Nevertheless, it has progressed enough that I want to request comments
from the community.

There are a number of TODOs in the code to which I need input.

Notably, it seems (half-)illegal to use a shared static reference to an
Atomic, which I currently use for the dma_fence unit test / docstring
test. I'm willing to rework that if someone suggests how.
(Still, shouldn't changing a global Atomic always be legal? It can race,
of course. But that's kind of the point of an atomic)

What I want comments on the most is the design of the callbacks. I think
it's a great opportunity to provide Rust drivers with rust-only
callbacks, so that they don't have to bother about the C functions.

dma_fence wise, only the most basic callbacks currently get implemented.
For Nova, AFAICS, we don't need much more than signalling fences and
registering callbacks.


Another, solvable, issue I'm having is designing the
dma_fence_begin_signallin() abstractions. There are TODOs about that in
the code. That should ideally be robust and not racy. So we might want
some sort of synchronized (locked?) way for using that abstraction.


Regarding the manually created spinlock of mine: I so far never need
that spinlock anywhere in Rust and wasn't sure what's then the best way
to pass a "raw" spinlock to C.


So much from my side. Hope to hear from you.

(I've compiled and tested this with the unit test on the current -rc3)

Philipp
