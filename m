This patch series introduces failsafe migration blits.
The reason for this seemingly strange concept is that if the initial
clearing or readback of LMEM fails for some reason[1], and we then set up
either GPU- or CPU ptes to the allocated LMEM, we can expose old
contents from other clients.

So after each migration blit to LMEM, attach a dma-fence callback that
checks the migration fence error value and if it's an error,
performs a memcpy blit, instead.

Patch 1 splits out the TTM move code into separate files
Patch 2 implements the failsafe blits and related self-tests

[1] There are at least two ways we could trigger exposure of uninitialized
LMEM assuming the migration blits themselves never trigger a gpu hang.

a) A gpu operation preceding a pipelined eviction blit resets and sets the
error fence to -EIO, and the error is propagated across the TTM manager to
the clear / swapin blit of a newly allocated TTM resource. It aborts and
leaves the memory uninitialized.

b) Something wedges the GT while a migration blit is submitted. It ends up
never executed and TTM can fault user-space cpu-ptes into uninitialized
memory.

v3:
- Style fixes in second patch (Matthew Auld)
v4:
- More style fixes in second patch (Matthew Auld)
v5:
- Fix an issue where we might end up waiting for a fence that would
  never signal.
