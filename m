As I already explained, the fences can outlive their scheduler. That 
means *this* entity certainly exists for *this* scheduler, but the 
*dependency* fence might have come from a past scheduler that was 
already destroyed along with all of its entities, and its address reused.

Christian, I'm really getting tired of your tone. I don't appreciate 
being told my comments are "outright nonsense" when you don't even take 
the time to understand what the issue is and what I'm trying to 
do/document. If you aren't interested in working with me, I'm just going 
to give up on drm_sched, wait until Rust gets workqueue support, and 
reimplement it in Rust. You can keep your broken fence lifetime 
semantics and I'll do my own thing.

~~ Lina
