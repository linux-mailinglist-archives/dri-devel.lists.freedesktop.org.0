--- Comment #4 from Nicholas Kazlauskas <nicholas.kazlauskas@amd.com> ---
What's the latest commit in your WIP kernel?

I know there was a regression caused by:

https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/304544/

that forces full updates on every commit leading to pretty poor performance=
. I
have a patch that fixes this that didn't make into that set of DC patches.

But I also don't think this last set is merged yet into amd-staging-drm-nex=
t,
so it's likely something other than this - and likely something in the lega=
cy
codepath if disabling atomic support in modesetting causes the issue.
