> Currently pointers to and from are not initialized and may contain
> garbage values. This will cause uninitialized pointer reads in the
> call to intel_frontbuffer_track and later checks to see if to and from
> are null.  Fix this by ensuring to and from are initialized to NULL.

> Addresses-Coverity: ("Uninitialised pointer read)"
