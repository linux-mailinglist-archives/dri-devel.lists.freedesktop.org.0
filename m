I changed back code step by step and could find what makes a significant
difference. Here are the main tests achieved (results in Mbits/sec):

1) Page pool without XDP code -> res = 442
Conclusion: No difference with or without XDP code.

2) From 1), page pool removed and replaced by previous memory model
based on dev_alloc_page() function -> res =418
Conclusion: Your advice was good, that's better with page pool. :)

3) From 2), am65_cpsw_alloc_skb() function removed and replaced by
netdev_alloc_skb_ip_align(), as used by the driver before -> res = 506
Conclusion: Here is where the loss comes from.
IOW, My am65_cpsw_alloc_skb() function is not good.

Initially, I mainly created this 'custom' am65_cpsw_alloc_skb() function
because I thought that none of XDP memory models could be used along
with netdev_alloc_skb_ip_align() function. Was I wrong ?
ByÂ creating this custom am65_cpsw_alloc_skb(), I also wanted to handle
the way headroom is reserved differently.
