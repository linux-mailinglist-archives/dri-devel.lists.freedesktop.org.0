Yes, that's what I would suggest. I don't know the i.MX8M clock tree
very well, so I don't know which other clocks might be influenced when
the video_pll clock changes its rate. But if you have to change the PLL
rate anyway it shouldn't make a difference if you change it directly
or if you let the rate change propagate up from disp_pixel_clk.
