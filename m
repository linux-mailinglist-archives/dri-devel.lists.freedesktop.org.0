Yeah this is really badly breaking expectations of generic userspace :-/

Instead of trying to detect generic userspace, which I think is futile
because there's really not anything beyoned "generic userspace expects
gem handles, so give it to them", would it be possible to detect the
legacy driver somehow? Because generic kms clients are really not required
to use any specific feature at all that kms provides, so I don't think
there's a way to reliably detect those that works across everything.

Like some legacy ioctl/parameter set that only the legacy xorg-modesetting
driver uses should fit the bill here, or maybe a combination of them. Some
ideas:

- if you get an ADDFB call with a legacy buffer (not a gem buffer), mark
  the client as legacy and then return legacy buffer handles, not gem ones
  from fd2handle.

- maybe similar for "you get a legacy buffer handle for SETCURSOR ioctl"

- maybe there's a unique setup sequence that only the xorg driver uses?
  Like a sequence of ioctl/ioctl parameters that's unique to the old xorg
  driver.

It's still brittle, but since no one's working on the legacy driver
anymore you only need to chase this once and then be done. And it /should/
allow you to implement standard gem behaviour by default for all these
standard ioctls that generic userspace expects to work, and only use the
old behaviour when you detect the legacy userspace and have set the
fpriv->uses_legacy_buffer_handles flag.

A really bonkers fix would be to merge the buffer handle xarrays into one
and use one of the tag bits to denote whether it's a legacy or gem one,
and then allow GEM_CLOSE to close them all. But that's really ugly and
probably way too much surgery.

Cheers, Sima
