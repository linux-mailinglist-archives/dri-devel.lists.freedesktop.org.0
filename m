One additional thought on one sub-topic:

I didn't get much time to brainstorm this just yet, only one downside 
randomly came to mind later - with this approach for i915 we wouldn't 
correctly attribute any GPU activity done in the receiving process 
against our default contexts. Those would still be accounted to the 
sending process.

How much problem in practice that would be remains to be investigated, 
including if it applies to other drivers too. If there is a good amount 
of deployed userspace which use the default context, then it would be a 
bit messy.

Regards,

Tvrtko

*) For non DRM and non i915 people, default context is a GPU submission 
context implicitly created during the device node open. It always 
remains valid, including in the receiving process if SCM_RIGHTS is used.
