We have panel-simple-dsi for DSI simple based panels.
This binding includes the reg property.

If we have included DSI panels in panel-simple.yaml, and we likely have
by accident, then they should be moved to panel-simple-dsi.yaml.

If they requires anything else then they shall have their
own binding.

panel-simple.yaml and panel-simple.dsi.yaml are on purpose
only for the simple panels and they have:
"additionalProperties: false" to avoid that a lot
of extra sneaks in.

I actually considered shortly a panel-simple-spi.yaml,
but the few panels I looked at had different names
for the power-supply so that did not fly.
I did not check them all - we have today (with this patch-set)
9 bindings that references spi-slave.yaml.
