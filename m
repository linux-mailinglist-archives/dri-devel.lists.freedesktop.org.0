> Is this roughly the same model every GPU vendor uses. GPUs are complex.

No offense intended! It is obvious that the maths being the same for everybody,
sensible hardware models will all look alike. It was more to underline the
significant "technical cost" difference between GL and vulkan.

To come back to this issue, I was willing to help this user "secure" a real
issue by reproducing it (since I run everything git) and provide a reasonable
context (free as in free beer) for you guys.
