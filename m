I don't understand your question. See below.

No. It means replacing extending existing entries with bigger reg and
#phy-cells = <1>. The driver must keep working with old node definitions
as is to ensure backwards compatibility. New nodes should make it
register two PHYs (USB3 and DP). On the driver side modify generic code
paths, all platforms supported by the driver should be able to support
USB3+DP combination.

Not quite. Both USB3 and DP drivers should be calling power_on / _off.
If USB3 is on, powering on DP PHY should fail. Vice versa, if DP is on,
powering on USB should fail.
