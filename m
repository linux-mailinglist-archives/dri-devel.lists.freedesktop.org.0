Hi all,

This time I really want to make forward progress on landing this. I'll like=
ly merge the first
half into drm-next soon, but I'd like to get it all landed.

The main changes since v4, is I did an AI review of the patchset and it fin=
d a bug=20
with the reclaim codepaths when no memcg was around, and a bug in the diff =
calcs
for accounted pages I introduced.

Christian, I think you said patch 4 got lost last time, hopefully you get i=
t this time.

Patches still needing ack/review:
ttm/pool: drop numa specific pools
ttm/pool: track allocated_pages per numa node.
ttm: add objcg pointer to bo and tt (v2)
ttm/pool: enable memcg tracking and shrinker. (v2)
amdgpu: add support for memory cgroups

Differences since v1 posting:
1. added ttm_bo_set_cgroup wrapper - the cgroup reference is passed to the =
ttm object.
2. put the cgroup reference in ttm object release
3. rebase onto 6.19-rc1
4. added xe support patch from Maarten.

Differences since v2 posting:
1. Squashed exports into where they are used (Shakeel)
2. Fixed bug in uncharge path memcg
3. Fixed config bug in the module option.

Differences since 1st posting:
1. Added patch 18: add a module option to allow pooled pages to not be stor=
ed in the lru per-memcg
   (Requested by Christian Konig)
2. Converged the naming and stats between vmstat and memcg (Suggested by Sh=
akeel Butt)
3. Cleaned up the charge/uncharge code and some other bits.

Dave.

Original cover letter:
tl;dr: start using list_lru/numa/memcg in GPU driver core and amdgpu driver=
 for now.

This is a complete series of patches, some of which have been sent before a=
nd reviewed,
but I want to get the complete picture for others, and try to figure out ho=
w best to land this.

There are 3 pieces to this:
01->02: add support for global gpu stat counters (previously posted, patch =
2 is newer)
03->06: port ttm pools to list_lru for numa awareness
07->13: add memcg stats + gpu apis, then port ttm pools to memcg aware list=
_lru and shrinker
14: enable amdgpu to use new functionality.
15: add a module option to turn it all off.

The biggest difference in the memcg code from previously is I discovered wh=
at
obj cgroups were designed for and I'm reusing the page/objcg intergration t=
hat=20
already exists, to avoid reinventing that wheel right now.

There are some igt-gpu-tools tests I've written at:
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/airlied/igt-gpu-tools/-/tree/amdgpu-cgroups?=
ref_type=3Dheads

One problem is there are a lot of delayed action, that probably means the t=
esting
needs a bit more robustness, but the tests validate all the basic paths.

Regards,
Dave.
