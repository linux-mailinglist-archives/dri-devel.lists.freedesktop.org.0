A couple of questions:

1) Since this now becomes uapi, are we completely sure that we are not 
going to want to map these bos cached when they are evicted or migrated. 
If we think we are going to want to do that, we should probably just 
silently accept any mapping mode user-space wants and then have the 
kernel override user-space's wishes.

Ping Daniel about this as well.

2) How are we going to handle kernel maps to make sure we don't use a 
different kernel map caching mode to these objects. Will that be a later 
series? Seems like we at least need to modify "i915_coherent_map_type"

Apart from this, code looks good to me.
