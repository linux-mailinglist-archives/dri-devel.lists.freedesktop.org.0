If someone maps the memory backed by the DMA-buf outside of the DMA-APIs then we cannot really
control that, but in this case if they do map with the DMA-API then it is *not* valid to skip
these begin_access and end_access callbacks. And that is the case I am addressing here.

Right now we are not syncing the mapping for any attached device, we just zap it from
the CPU caches using some hacky loopback and hope that is enough for the devices :/

I was not aware of this mangle_sg_table() hack, must have been added while I was not looking :)

Seems very broken TBH, taking a quick look, I see on this line[0] you call it, then
just a couple lines later you use that same mangled page_link to walk the SG table[1]..

If anyone enables DMA_API_DEBUG and tried to attach/map a non-contiguous DMA-BUF with
a chained sg I don't see how that doesn't crash out.

Could you point me to where Heaps uses a copy of the SG table? I see it using the
exact same SG table for dma_sync_sgtable_for_*() that we created when mapping the
device attachments.

Thanks,
Andrew
