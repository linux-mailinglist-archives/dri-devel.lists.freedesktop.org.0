The datasheet I have should be the same as yours, and the T3 is "Min. 
2ms | Typ. 30ms | Max. 50ms" with the gray "Measurement not available".

Yes, it is indeed better to set the "powered_on_to_enable" to 335ms, as 
this will help prevent the display from showing invalid black screens. I 
will add it in the next version.

According to the datasheet, it is a good idea to set "disable" to 200ms.

The ID "0x0000" makes me nervous too, but the EDID obtained from this 
panel indeed show it, which is quite surprising. May I still set it to 
"0x0000" as it really is?

Best regards,
