Uninitialised globals end up as 'named common' (variables that are
their own code section - from FORTRAN) until the final link puts
them into the .bss.
Globals initialised to 0 go into the .bss of the object file
being created.

So both end up in the final .bss.

If the code goes into a module you aren't allowed 'common' data
in a module to every global must be initialised.

I'm surprised checkpatch complains.
