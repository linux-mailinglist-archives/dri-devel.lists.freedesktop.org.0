We're talking specifically about cases where the logic in a pmu's
pmu::event_init() callback doesn't count events in specific states, and
hence the 5th even doesn't get rejected when it is initialised.

For example, in arch/x86/events/core.c, validate_group() uses
collect_events(), which has:

	for_each_sibling_event(event, leader) {
		if (!is_x86_event(event) || event->state <= PERF_EVENT_STATE_OFF)
			continue;

		if (collect_event(cpuc, event, max_count, n))
			return -EINVAL;

		n++;
	}

... and so where an event's state is <= PERF_EVENT_STATE_OFF at init
time, that event is not counted to see if it fits into HW counters.

Mark.
