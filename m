You are right, thank you for pointing this out. FYI I will include the 
following explanation in the patch message:

This will resolve two issues that were encountered where a driver was 
left in an incomplete state as the bottom-half was canceled:
a) Cancelling context-abort of a job that is still executing and is 
causing translation faults which is going to cause additional TDRs,
b) Cancelling bottom-half of a DCT (duty-cycle throttling) request which 
will cause a device to not be adjusted to an external frequency request.

Best regards,
Maciej
