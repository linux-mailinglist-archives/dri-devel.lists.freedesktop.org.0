Not anything you'll notice. BPF is used in network on much more
demanding latency purposes. And IIRC, jumping into BPF is almost a no-op
nowadays. From what I can tell from the BPF maintainer in his ALPSS
presentation last week:
"
BPF C code is compiled into BPF ISA with BPF calling convention,
JIT translate BPF ISA into native ISA,
One to one mapping of BPF registers to x86 registers.
"

Nope. It gets loaded once udev enumerates the device, so unless you
craft a special intird with both the loader and the bpf object it is
not.

However, if that rainbow is bothering you, you can "initialize" the
keyboard to a sane state with your WMI-to-HID driver before exposing the
device to HID.

FWIW, the use of BPF only allows you to not corner yourself. If you
failed at your LampArray implementation, you'll have to deal with it
forever-ish. So it's perfectly sensible to use BPF as an intermediate step
where you develop both userspace and kernel space and then convert back
the BPF into a proper HID driver.

Being able to develop a kernel driver without having to reboot and
being sure you won't crash your kernel is a game changer ;)

Cheers,
Benjamin
