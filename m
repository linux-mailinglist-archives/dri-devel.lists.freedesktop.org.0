The issue here is the explicit ownership transfer.

We intentionally decided against that because it breaks tons of use 
cases and is at least by me and a couple of others seen as generally 
design failure of the Linux DMA-API.

DMA-Buf let's the exporter setup the DMA addresses the importer uses to 
be able to directly decided where a certain operation should go. E.g. we 
have cases where for example a P2P write doesn't even go to memory, but 
rather a doorbell BAR to trigger another operation. Throwing in CPU 
round trips for explicit ownership transfer completely breaks that concept.

Additional to that a very basic concept of DMA-buf is that the exporter 
provides the buffer as it is and just double checks if the importer can 
access it. For example we have XGMI links which makes memory accessible 
to other devices on the same bus, but not to PCIe device and not even to 
the CPU. Otherwise you wouldn't be able to implement things like secure 
decoding where the data isn't even accessible outside the device to 
device link.

So if a device driver uses cached system memory on an architecture which 
devices which can't access it the right approach is clearly to reject 
the access.

What we can do is to reverse the role of the exporter and importer and 
let the device which needs uncached memory take control. This way this 
device can insert operations as needed, e.g. flush read caches or 
invalidate write caches.

This is what we have already done in DMA-buf and what already works 
perfectly fine with use cases which are even more complicated than a 
simple write cache invalidation.

Yes, exactly that.

It's the job of the higher level to prepare the buffer a device work 
with, not the one of the lower level.

In other words in a proper design the higher level would prepare the 
memory in a way the device driver can work with it, not the other way 
around.

When a device driver gets memory it can't work with the correct response 
is to throw an error and bubble that up into a layer where it can be 
handled gracefully.

For example instead of using bounce buffers under the hood the DMA layer 
the MM should make sure that when you call read() with O_DIRECT that the 
pages in question are accessible by the device.

Yeah, I'm perfectly aware of that. The problem is that exactly that 
design totally breaks GPUs on Xen DOM0 for example.

And Xen is just one example, I can certainly say from experience that 
this design was a really really bad idea because it favors just one use 
case while making other use cases practically impossible if not really 
hard to implement.
