Sorry, but this is just ignoring reality. You try to flag 8+ years of
DMA-buf usage on non-coherent arches as "you shouldn't do this". At
this point there are probably a lot more users (drivers) of DMA-buf in
the kernel for devices, which are used on non-coherent arches, than
there are on coherent arches.

Non coherent access, including your non-snoop scanout, and no domain
transition signal just doesn't go together when you want to solve
things in a generic way.

Remember that in a fully (not only IO) coherent system the CPU isn't
the only agent that may cache the content you are trying to access
here. The dirty cacheline could reasonably still be sitting in a GPU or
VPU cache, so you need some way to clean those cachelines, which isn't
a magic "importer knows how to call CPU cache clean instructions".

Can you point me to that part of the documentation? A quick grep for
"coherent" didn't immediately turn something up within the DMA-buf
dirs.
