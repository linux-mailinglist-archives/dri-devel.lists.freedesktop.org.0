Ack. Was meant to come back to that after discussing some of the locking 
questions below. The other side effect of splitting this code out is it leaves 
space for more specific documentation which is only a good thing. I will try 
and summarise some of the discussion below into a comment here.

Thanks for confirming. The documentation in Documentation/vm/unevictable-
lru.rst is helpful for higher level context but I will put some comments here 
around the logic.

Ha, thanks. I had just copied the comment without checking to see if mmap_lock 
was always held by callers of page_mlock() or not. From what I can tell it is 
which confirms what you are saying. Thanks.

Fair enough, I agree it isn't obvious from just reading the code so will 
incorporate a summary from the unevictable-lru documentation (which would have 
been helpful to have had referenced originally anyway).

No, I don't think that is correct. Sorry for the confusion. I updated the name 
with a script but obviously missed some of the comments. When reviewing this 
for rebasing I noticed a few other places in the code still incorrectly 
referencing this as an munlock so will go through and improve the comments 
more generally.

I think a better description of what this function does and why might help 
with the inevitable confusion that arises from munlock calling a function to
