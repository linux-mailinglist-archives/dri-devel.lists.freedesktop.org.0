Hmm. One thing that worries me a bit here: Let's say we have, for
example an LMEM context state, and TTM has it made unshrinkable. Then
the context becomes active and calls _make_unshrinkable again. And when
it retires it callse _make_shrinkable. Doesn't it end up on the
shrinker list at that point, even if still in LMEM?
