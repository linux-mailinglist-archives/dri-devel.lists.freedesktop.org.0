No, the section of the MIPI DSI spec I posted below clearly states there 
are two options:

1) send blanking packets during those periods
2) transition to LP11 during those periods

There is no 3rd option in the spec of not doing both like what you are 
suggesting. So DSIM should also be only transitioning to LP11 during 
those periods if its not sending the blanking packets with those flags set.

So, there is no need for any new set of flags to differentiate.

The flags and their interpretation is correct in MSM driver. I cannot 
comment on what exactly DSIM does with those flags.

No, there is no need of another new flag. There are only two options as 
per the spec.

In fact, as per my checking with more folks, requiring LP11 during those 
periods is something very rare.

Because usually horizontal period is usually a very short period, most 
of the time we do not use the LP11 option and send the blanking packets 
instead.

So its something very unusual for DSIM.

That being said, I still think my previous question is important.

1) What is the difference between the resolution you are trying Vs what 
Amit is trying?

2) Are you both using just standard HDMI monitors?

Standard HDMI monitors follow VESA or CEA which usually have pretty low 
hblank so its not surprising that the LP11 option does not work as the 
blanking time is not sufficient for this LP<->HS transition.
