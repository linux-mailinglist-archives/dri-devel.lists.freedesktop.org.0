--- Comment #218 from L.S.S. <ragnaros39216@yandex.com> ---
It seems the page fault issue has been already reported here. I also found
similar page faults in the log sometimes when the lockup occurred (I think
it'll definitely show up if I leave the system as is for a prolonged amount=
 of
time).

https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/issues/2053

I'm not an expert of apitrace, but the reporter provided a trace that would
100% reproduce the lockup, and he was able to bisect the call that caused t=
he
lockup which is the last call of that trace file.
