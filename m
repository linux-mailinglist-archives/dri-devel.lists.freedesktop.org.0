There is a patch for mesa, I'll work on getting that upstreamed too.

I haven't tested this under memory pressure conditions. That should be a
userspace issue though.

For userspace managed surfaces, the driver only accepts ids in the range
1 to 32768 (VMWGFX_NUM_GB_SURFACE) and for an old kernel managed surfaces
it only returns ids in range starting at 53040 (VMWGFX_NUM_MOB).
So if userspace defines a surface with the old ioctls and then tries to
issue the gb_surface_destroy on that surface with that id then the command
buffer submission will fail because it won't pass the res checks.

There is no such flag right now, I will add this.
