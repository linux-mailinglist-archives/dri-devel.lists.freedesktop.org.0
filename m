The CPU domain should be static for discrete, and on DG1 we don't need
any flushing since everything is already coherent, so really all this
does is an object wait, for which we have an ioctl. Longer term the
desired caching should be an immutable creation time property for the
BO, which can be set with something like gem_create_ext.

One other user is iris + userptr, which uses the set_domain to probe all
the pages to check if the GUP succeeds, however keeping the set_domain
around just for that seems rather scuffed. We could equally just submit
a dummy batch, which should hopefully be good enough, otherwise adding a
new creation time flag for userptr might be an option. Although longer
term we will also have vm_bind, which should also be a nice fit for
this, so adding a whole new flag is likely overkill.

v2: add some more kernel doc, also add the implicit rules with caching
