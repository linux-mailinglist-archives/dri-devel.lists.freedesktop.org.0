Well, I think it's the finally solution, for current thinking, it maybe bring a high
overloading. Just as this revert patch: 
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CA+wgaPMHA+8+LxfGNL+q4=XrdXqfu4TXoWLX7e28z9Z7kPsf-w@mail.gmail.com/
So, we need to find a lightweight way to do this.

Yes, It's also a error case, I will remove to lock at next version patch. Thanks!

Sorry, could you tell me wich function will check it?
I didn't found it so I submit this patch.

I also printed dmabuf->exp_name in warn message.

The reason adding it here is that some users on ANDROID of dma-buf is not familiar
with linux dma-buf or maybe write some problematic code, add this check can find
who lost call get_dma_buf or any other api can let let the dma-buf lifecycle is
under users' expectation.
Add it just like check in dma-fence:
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/dma-buf/dma-fence.c#L519

Do you have any suggestion to debug this part?
