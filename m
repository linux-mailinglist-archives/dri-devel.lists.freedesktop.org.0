Hi,
 
chained to this message is a driver for CH7033 along with device tree
binding docs. I'm hoping that it could perhaps make it into 5.7. Please
take a look.
 
The only change compared to the previous submission [1] is the fix in the
DT bindings example discovered by the validation tool.
 
[1] https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200307190800.142658-1-lkundrak@v3.sk/
 
Tested to work well on MMP3-based Dell Wyse 3020. There's no datasheet or
programming manual available.
 
Thanks,
Lubo
