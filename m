Add documentation for device wedged event in a new 'Device wedging'
chapter. The describes basic definitions, prerequisites and consumer
expectations along with an example.

 v8: Improve documentation (Christian, Rodrigo)
 v9: Add prerequisites section (Christian)
v10: Clarify mmap cleanup and consumer prerequisites (Christian, Aravind)

+the first place. For this, drivers can make use of devcoredump to store relevant
+information about the reset and send device wedged event without recovery method
+(as explained in next chapter) to notify userspace, so this information can be
+collected and added to user bug reports.
+
+Device wedging
+==============
+
+Drivers can optionally make use of device wedged event (implemented as
+drm_dev_wedged_event() in DRM subsystem), which notifies userspace of 'wedged'
+(hanged/unusable) state of the DRM device through a uevent. This is useful
+especially in cases where the device is no longer operating as expected and
+has become unrecoverable from driver context. Purpose of this implementation
+is to provide drivers a generic way to recover with the help of userspace
+intervention without taking any drastic measures in the driver.
+
+A 'wedged' device is basically a dead device that needs attention. The
+uevent is the notification that is sent to userspace along with a hint about
+what could possibly be attempted to recover the device and bring it back to
+usable state. Different drivers may have different ideas of a 'wedged' device
+depending on their hardware implementation, and hence the vendor agnostic
+nature of the event. It is up to the drivers to decide when they see the need
+for device recovery and how they want to recover from the available methods.
+
+Driver prerequisites
+--------------------
+
+The driver, before opting for recovery, needs to make sure that the 'wedged'
+device doesn't harm the system as a whole by taking care of the prerequisites.
+Necessary actions must include disabling DMA to system memory as well as any
+communication channels with other devices. Further, the driver must ensure
+that all dma_fences are signalled and any device state that the core kernel
+might depend on is cleaned up. Any existing mmap should be invalidated and
+page faults should be redirected to a dummy page. Once the event is sent, the
+device must be kept in 'wedged' state until the recovery is performed. New
+accesses to the device (IOCTLs) should be blocked, preferably with an error
+code that resembles the type of failure the device has encountered. This will
+signify the reason for wedging, which can be reported to the application if
+needed.
+
+Recovery
+--------
+
+Current implementation defines three recovery methods, out of which, drivers
+can use any one, multiple or none. Method(s) of choice will be sent in the
+uevent environment as ``WEDGED=<method1>[,<method2>]`` in order of less to
+more side-effects. If driver is unsure about recovery or method is unknown
+(like soft/hard reboot, firmware flashing, hardware replacement or any other
+procedure which can't be attempted on the fly), ``WEDGED=unknown`` will be
+sent instead.
+
+Userspace consumers can parse this event and attempt recovery as per the
+following expectations.
+
+    =============== ================================
+    Recovery method Consumer expectations
+    =============== ================================
+    none            optional telemetry collection
+    rebind          unbind + bind driver
+    bus-reset       unbind + reset bus device + bind
+    unknown         admin/user policy
+    =============== ================================
+
+The only exception to this is ``WEDGED=none``, which signifies that the
+device was temporarily 'wedged' at some point but was able to recover using
+device specific methods like reset. No explicit device recovery is expected
+from the consumer in this case, but it can still take additional steps like
+gathering telemetry information (devcoredump, syslog). This is useful
+because the first hang is usually the most critical one which can result in
+consequential hangs or complete wedging.
+
+Consumer prerequisites
+----------------------
+
+It is the responsibility of the consumer to make sure that the device or
+its resources are not in use by any process before attempting recovery.
+With IOCTLs blocked and device already 'wedged', all device memory should
+be unmapped and file descriptors should be closed to prevent leaks.
+
+Example
+-------
+
+Udev rule::
+
+    SUBSYSTEM=="drm", ENV{WEDGED}=="rebind", DEVPATH=="*/drm/card[0-9]",
+    RUN+="/path/to/rebind.sh $env{DEVPATH}"
+
+Recovery script::
+
+    #!/bin/sh
+
+    DEVPATH=$(readlink -f /sys/$1/device)
+    DEVICE=$(basename $DEVPATH)
+    DRIVER=$(readlink -f $DEVPATH/driver)
+
+    echo -n $DEVICE > $DRIVER/unbind
+    sleep 1
+    echo -n $DEVICE > $DRIVER/bind
+
+Customization
+-------------
+
+Although basic recovery is possible with a simple script, admin/users can
+define custom policies around recovery action. For example, if the driver
+supports multiple recovery methods, consumers can opt for the suitable one
+based on policy definition. Consumers can also choose to have the device
+available for debugging or additional data collection before performing the
+recovery. This is useful especially when the driver is unsure about recovery
+or method is unknown.
