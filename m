No. See drivers/Makefile:
obj-$(CONFIG_GENERIC_PHY)	+= phy/

so the drivers/phy/ subdir is only built when CONFIG_GENERIC_PHY is set,
but it's not set.

defconfig doesn't matter in this case. The .config that was provided has:
# CONFIG_GENERIC_PHY is not set
CONFIG_GENERIC_PHY_MIPI_DPHY=y

but yes, selecting GENERIC_PHY (needed in 3 places) does fix the warnings
and build error.  2 instance in drm/bridge/Kconfig and one in
drm/bridge/cadence/Kconfig (found by inspection).

I had no problem replicating the kconfig warnings and build error.
