Different approaches have been tried to signal resets and other errors in
vendor specific ways which not only resulted in a wide variety of
implementations but also repeating the same bugs and problems over different
drivers.

Document that drivers should use dma_fence based error signaling which is
vendor agnostic and allows userspace to query submission errors in generic
non-vendor specific code.

+it as needed. Usually a hang is detected when a job gets stuck executing.
+
+Propagation of errors to userspace has proven to be tricky since it goes in
+the opposite direction of the usual flow of commands. Because of this vendor
+independent error handling was added to the &dma_fence object, this way drivers
+can add an error code to their fences before signaling them. See function
+dma_fence_set_error() on how to do this and for examples of error codes to use.
+
+The DRM scheduler also allows setting error codes on all pending fences when
+hardware submissions are restarted after an reset. Error codes are also
+forwarded from the hardware fence to the scheduler fence to bubble up errors
+to the higher levels of the stack and eventually userspace.
+
+Fence errors can be queried by userspace through the generic SYNC_IOC_FILE_INFO
+IOCTL as well as through driver specific interfaces.
+
+Additional to setting fence errors drivers should also keep track of resets per
+context, the DRM scheduler provides the drm_sched_entity_error() function as
+helper for this use case. After a reset, KMD should reject new command
+submissions for affected contexts.
