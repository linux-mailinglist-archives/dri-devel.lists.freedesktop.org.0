Yes, this is exactly what was meant by "awkward constructs" in the 
commit message,

My thoughts are still that all this could be avoided by a different 
design for struct ttm_resource,
but I agree we can do with refcounted sg-lists for now, to see where 
this ends up when all related resource-on-lru stuff lands in TTM.
