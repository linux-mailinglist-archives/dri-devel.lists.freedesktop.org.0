As can be seen from the reviews:

- sleeps between DSI calls
- properly propagating the error at the end of the function
- making decision whether to create the context at the caller or the
  callee side. E.g. in patch 8 it is better to allocate context in
  hx8394_enable() and pass it to .init_sequence() instead of keeping
  some of error handling.

From my side: feel free to ask for the details if any of the emails is
not clear enough. At the same time, please review your patches before
sending them. Returning 0 in case there was an error is an obvious
issue.
