Agreed: that should make it disappear again, but as you say, it's just kicking
the problem down the road since now the failing condition is losing a race with
kfree()+kmalloc()+new contents.

And if you want to detect without crashing, you can just zero the padding at
init time and report when it's non-NULL at workqueue run time... I wonder if
KASAN can run in a mode where the allocation/freeing tracking happens, but
without the heavy checking instrumentation? Then when the corruption is
detected, it could dump a traceback about who did the early kfree()... hmmm.
