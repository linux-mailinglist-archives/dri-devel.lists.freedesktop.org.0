While leaving the fallback for user space to handle makes some sense in theory, in practice most KMS display servers likely won't handle it.

Another issue is that if mode validation is based on the maximum bpc value, it may reject modes which would work with lower bpc.


What Ville (CC'd) suggested before instead (and what i915 seems to be doing already) is that the driver should do mode validation based on the *minimum* bpc, and automatically make the effective bpc lower than the maximum as needed to make the rest of the atomic state work.
