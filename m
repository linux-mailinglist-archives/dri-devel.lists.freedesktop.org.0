Actually, it is not my rule. My rule is that never access other members
of the struct except for the list_head member after the loop, because
this is a invalid member after loop exit, but valid for the list_head
member which just is HEAD and the lately caculation (&pos->head) seems
harmless.

I have considered the case that the HEAD's container "pos" is layouted
across the max and the min address boundary, which means the address of
HEAD is likely 0x60, and the address of pos is likely 0xffffffe0.
It seems ok to caculate pos with:
((type *)(__mptr - offsetof(type, member)));
and it seems ok to caculate head outside the loop with:
if (&pos->head == &HEAD)
    return NULL;

The only case I can think of with the rule "never run container_of()
on HEAD" must be followed is when the first argument (which is &HEAD)
passing to container_of() is NULL + some offset, it may lead to the
resulting "pos->member" access being a NULL dereference. But maybe
the caller can take the responsibility to check if it is NULL, not
container_of() itself.

Please remind me if i missed somthing, thanks.

Sorry for the confusion, indeed, that is two *different* rule.

It does not. My rule is: never access the iterator variable outside the loop.
The "Making the iterator NULL on loop exit" way still leak the pos with NULL
outside the loop, may lead to a NULL deference.

Yes, it is more simple and compatible with existing interfaces. Howerver,
you should make every developers to remember that "pos will be set NULL on
loop exit", which is unreasonable and impossible for *every* single person.
Otherwise the mis-use-after-loop will lead to a NULL dereference.
But we can kill this problem by declaring iterator inside the loop and the
complier will catch it if somebody mis-use-after-loop.

Yes, the NULLify approach is better than the current list_for_each_entry()
macro, but i stick with that the list_for_each_entry_inside() way is best
and perfect _technically_.

Thus, my idea is *better a finger off than always aching*, let's settle this
damn problem once and for all, with list_for_each_entry_inside().
