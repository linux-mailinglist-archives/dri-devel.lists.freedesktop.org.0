I only added support for the format used by simpledrm, because I don't 
want to add support for all possible format if no driver are using it.
It should be possible to add YUV format too.

I also prefer to convert only the foreground/background color, and then 
write directly into the buffers, instead of converting line by line.
It works for all format where pixel size is a multiple of byte.

I think reusing the atomic commit functions might be hard, because there 
are locks/allocation/threads hidden in drivers callback. I'm more in 
favor of an emergency function, that each driver has to implement, and 
use what the hardware can do to display a simple frame quickly.
get_scanout_buffer() is a good start for simple driver, but will need 
refactoring for the more complex case, like adding a callback to write 
pixels one by one, if there is no memory mapped buffer available.

Yes I should better document the drm panic feature, and the 
get_scanout_buffer() interface.
