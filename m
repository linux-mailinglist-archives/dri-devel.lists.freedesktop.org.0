Well, these questions were evaluated. And this resulted in our 
suggestion to reuse DP driver, INTF_DP type and priv->dp array.

I'm also not in favour of splitting priv->dp into ->dp and ->edp.

One of the reasons, pointed out by Bjorn, is that some of interfaces can 
be used for both DP and eDP. Adding them to either of arrays would 
create confusion.

Second reason being that introducing the split would bring in extra code 
for no additional benefits. From the DPU point of view both DP and eDP 
interfaces look the same.

And we also might need to separte eDP-behind msm/dp and old-8x74-eDP.
It the same "possible" future that we might face.

I did some research for the INTF_*. As you probably remember (I didn't) 
on mdp4 and mdp5 chipsets we program the DISP_INTF_SEL registers, 
telling the hardware which hardware is to be driven by each of INTFs.
The freely available 410E HRD demands that this register is written.

At some point this became unnecessary, but the DPU driver kept INTF_* 
intact. Including INTF_EDP, INTF_LCDC, INTF_HDMI, etc. However from my 
understanding INTF_EDP would correspond to older eDP interfaces, not to 
eDP panels being connected by the contemporary DP/eDP ports.

Oh, and last but not least, I'd suggest to follow downstream, which uses 
"dp" to name all of DP/EDP ports. See 
https://github.com/TheXPerienceProject/android_kernel_xiaomi_courbet/blob/xpe-16.0/arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/sdmshrike-sde.dtsi#L89

So, to summarize my proposal:
- Keep INTF_EDP reserved for 8x74/8x84
- Use INTF_DP for all contemporary DP and eDP ports
- Documet this in dpu_hw_mdss.h
- Remove INTF_EDP usage in dpu1 driver.
