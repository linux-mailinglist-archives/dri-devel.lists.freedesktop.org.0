A variety of issues both in function and in power consumption have been
raised as a result of devices not being put into a low power state when
the system is powered off.

There have been some localized changes[1] to PCI core to help these issues,
but they have had various downsides.

This series instead uses the driver hibernate flows when the system is
being powered off or halted.  This lines up the behavior with what other
operating systems do as well.  If for some reason that fails or is not
supported, run driver shutdown() callbacks.

Rafael did mention in earlier versions of the series concerns about
regression risk.  He was looking for thoughts from Greg who isn't against
it but also isn't sure about how to maintain it. [1]

This has been validated by me and several others in AMD
on a variety of AMD hardware platforms. It's been validated by some
community members on their Intel hardware. To my knowledge it has not
been validated on non-x86.

On my development laptop I have also contrived failures in the hibernation
callbacks to make sure that the fallback to shutdown callback works.

In order to assist with potential regressions the series also includes
documentation to help with getting a kernel log at shutdown after
the disk is unmounted.
