Flags are not static, currently. If migrating from LMEM to SYSTEM, they
need to be updated. Caching and domains should remain unchanged for now
because of the rule that we don't want to change caching mode when
migrating from LMEM to SYSTEM for buffers that support both, and that
rule is enforced by setting the ttm_tt caching mode accordingly.
However, I figure if we need to change that rule moving forward because
we decide we can't rely on the TTM shinker for WC system pages, or
because allocating WC system pages is too expensive, It would be good
if we don't need to audit all the code to find places where an updated
caching policy needs changes.
