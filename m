Yeah these acpi-calls might take like a 100 ms easily, so
we really want to avoid it if it is not necessary.

Ok, so I have the feeling that you have an idea of how you think this
should be done / how this code should look instead of what I have
currently.

Can you perhaps provide a rough sketch / description of how you
think this should be done (instead of the current implementation) ?

Should I do the update from the the encoder update_pipe (for fast-sets)
and enable (for full modesets) callbacks instead as I mention in
the commit message ?

And since I still only want to do the call if there is an actual
change, where could I best do the old / new sw_state change cmp to
set the new foo_changed flag?

True, the idea here is to only update the hw_state, the returned sw_state
should always be the one which we just set. But I agree it would be better to
change the code here so that drm_connector_update_privacy_screen() only
updates privacy_screen_hw_state I will change the code to do this in the
next version of this patch-set.

Hans
