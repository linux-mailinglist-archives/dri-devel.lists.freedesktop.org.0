--- Comment #27 from yaomtc@protonmail.com ---
Created attachment 289535
  --> https://bugzilla.kernel.org/attachment.cgi?id=289535&action=edit
systemd journal from crash

Update: got a whole system crash again when I was starting up SteamVR. So I
guess the issue wasn't resolved for me. It could have reduced the likelihood
maybe, or it was luck?

Not sure what else to attach here, but I copied journal entries from the time
of the crash (which happens at 21:09:31 near the end). Let me know if there's
something else I should attach the next time this happens, if more data would
be helpful.
