Hi Krzysztof, Matt,

The img,bxm-4-64 GPU IP itself is designed with two separate power
domains. The TH1520 SoC, which integrates this GPU, wires both of these
to a single OS controllable power gate (controlled via mailbox and E902
co-processor).

This means a devicetree for the TH1520 can only ever provide one power
domain for the GPU. However, a generic binding for img,bxm-4-64 should
account for a future SoC that might implement both power domains.

That's why I proposed to relax the constraints on the img,bmx-4-64 GPU.

This makes the binding accurately represent the GPU's full capabilities
while remaining compatible with SoCs like the TH1520 that have a limited
implementation.

Does this seem like the correct and robust approach to you?
