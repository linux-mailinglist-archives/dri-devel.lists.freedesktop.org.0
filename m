That isn't an issue here because the memory is only intended to be
used with P2P transfers so it must be CPU accessible.

Well, now we have DEVICE_PRIVATE memory that can meet this need
too.. Just nobody has wired it up to hmm_range_fault()

You still have the issue that this patch is doing all of this P2P
stuff wrong - following the already NAK'd AMD approach.

It is trivial to get the struct page for a PCI BAR.
