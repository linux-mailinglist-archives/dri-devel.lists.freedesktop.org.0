Thank you guys for the ideas!

I'm going to work on something along on those lines, having combinations
of formats, rotations and whatever property that might be useful for
stress testing the driver. Maybe query the driver for the supported
properties (e.g. what formats and rotations it supports) and do many/all
possible combinations.
