<tldr>
Replacing FIFO with a flavour of deadline driven scheduling and removing round-
robin. Connecting the scheduler with dma-fence deadlines. First draft and
testing by different drivers and feedback would be nice. I was only able to test
it with amdgpu. Other drivers may not even compile.
</tldr>

If I remember correctly Christian mentioned recently (give or take) that maybe
round-robin could be removed. That got me thinking how and what could be
improved and simplified. So I played a bit in the scheduler code and came up
with something which appears to not crash at least. Whether or not there are
significant advantages apart from maybe code consolidation and reduction is the
main thing to be determined.

One big question is whether round-robin can really be removed. Does anyone use
it, rely on it, or what are even use cases where it is much better than FIFO.

See "drm/sched: Add deadline policy" commit message for a short description on
what flavour of deadline scheduling it is. But in essence it should a more fair
FIFO where higher priority can not forever starve lower priorities.

"drm/sched: Connect with dma-fence deadlines" wires up dma-fence deadlines to
the scheduler because it is easy and makes logical sense with this. And I
noticed userspace already uses it so why not wire it up fully.

Otherwise the series is a bit of progression from consolidating RR into FIFO
code paths and going from there to deadline and then to a change in how
dependencies are handled. And code simplification to 1:1 run queue to scheduler
relationship, because deadline does not need per priority run queues.

There is quite a bit of code to go throught here so I think it could be even
better if other drivers could give it a spin as is and see if some improvements
can be detected. Or at least no regressions.
