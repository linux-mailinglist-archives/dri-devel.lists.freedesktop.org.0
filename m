Thomas Z. refactored the entire modeset=0 handling to be more consistent
across drivers, so I think in practice it'll again only happen with the
nvidia blob driver (unless you patch in the call to
drm_firmware_drivers_only()). Or if you dont use nomodeset or similar and
instead use a driver-specific module option, which isn't what howtos in
distros recommend.

I can add this to the commit message if you want?
