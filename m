I'm confused about the split between get and send feature reports 
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/hid/hidraw.html

I guess then a get feature report can also carry input data and the difference 
is that a send feature report doesn't wait for a reply? but then what is it's 
reason of existence in contrast to an output report?

Thanks for reminding me that output reports exist xD.

I will look into it.

Since the interface is fixed I don't need to flesh out the whole descriptor 
(which i thought i must do) and usage page (0xff42, because NB04 and the wmi has 
2 other ec controlling wmi interfaces besides the AB one), report usage 
(matching the wmi comand id's) and report size should be enough.

Werner
