Should some error codes be documented and has the ability to

Text should be clear whether "not allowed" means there will be an error 
returned, or it will appear to work but bad things will happen.

What is the use case for allowing any random user to play with (global) 
TLB flushing?

As agreed the other day - please document in the main kerneldoc section 
that all (un)binds are executed asynchronously and out of order.

Do we want to provide TLB flushing guarantees here and why? (As opposed 
to leaving them for implementation details.) If there is no implied 
order in either binds/unbinds, or between the two intermixed, then what 
is the point of guaranteeing a TLB flush on unbind completion?

I am not sure the simplified ioctl story is super coherent. If 
everything is now fully async and out of order, but the input fence has 
been dropped, then how is userspace supposed to handle the address 
space? It will have to wait (in userspace) for unbinds to complete 
before submitting subsequent binds which use the same VA range.

Maybe that's passable, but then the fact execbuf3 has no input fence 
suggests a userspace wait between it and binds. And I am pretty sure 
historically those were always quite bad for performance.

Presumably userspace clients are happy with no input fences or it was 
considered to costly to implement it?
