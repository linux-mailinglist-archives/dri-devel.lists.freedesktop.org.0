Imo yes, otherwise we'll get really funny stuff like people bypass drm's
userspace requirement for e.g. content protected buffers by just shipping
the feature in a dma-buf heap ... Been there, done that.

Also I think especially with interop across components there's a huge
difference between a quick test program toy and the real thing. And
dma-buf heaps are kinda all about cross component interop.
