Hi Matt,

Thanks for the detailed explanation, that clears things up perfectly.

I agree with your assessment. Dropping the power-domain-names property
for this integration seems like the cleanest solution. As you pointed
out, since the OS sees only a single, undifferentiated power domain,
giving it a name like "gpu" would be redundant. This approach correctly
models the hardware without setting a potentially confusing precedent.

To follow through on this, I assume we'll need to adjust
pvr_power_domains_init() to handle nodes that don't have the
power-domain-names property. Does that sound right to you?
