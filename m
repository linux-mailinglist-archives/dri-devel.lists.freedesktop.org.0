--- Comment #8 from Richard Thier <u9vata@gmail.com> ---
I became a bit uncertain now as after every bisect I am choosing "git
bisect bad" and see no change so far. There is 4 more bisect to do
still, but I expected at least one change so far.

Maybe it is in xorg and not mesa??? Before bisecting with git I was
"bisecting" with the arch and ubuntu repo archives and there I had to
move xorg and mesa together always...

Also I am now confused about the version string in the glxinfo output
because I went through a point where I expected it to write "17.2.8"
and still it is writing "17.4.0". Is there a trick to exactly know
what git revision the 17.2.8 version was built out of? I might be
bisecting against the wrong "good" target... :-(
