Not necessarily. Some x370 and x470 motherboards erroneously reported PCIE =
4.0
support in earlier BIOS (AGESA) updates. You might want to update to the la=
test
available bios, if that is the case with your board.

Although, since you are using 5.3.1 I don't think the bug has been fixed in
mainline 5.3 yet. You might want to use amd-staging-drm-next, or wait for
4.1-rc1.
