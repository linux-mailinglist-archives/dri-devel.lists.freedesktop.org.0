This doesn't seem to trigger the bug at all for me, tho there's the expected
slowdown/judder from force-syncing all CRTCs as detailed in my last couple
comments.  But with the more serious side effects mnrzk is seeing with it, it's
clearly not useful as an even temporary mainline candidate.

I'll be testing mnrzk's patch now.  Hopefully it'll be good enough for the
quickly approaching 5.8, tho dev consensus seems to be that a deeper rework is
needed longer-term.
