OK, I'm about to reveal my ignorance.  I just got a chance to compile 5.6-rc7
to confirm that resume from suspend worked (it did), but I have no idea how to
bisect.  Googled for it and it looks like I need to be using git, but I'm just
downloading the tarball from kernel.org to compile my kernel.  Is this even
worth messing with given that it looks like we may have a stable 5.6 in the
near future?
