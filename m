Sorry, I didn't mean just a WARN_ON() - there should also be an early
return from the function, ideally with the GPU being reset in the hope
that it starts behaving again.

And you're probably right WARN_ON is a bit too strong, we should
definitely output a warning message though to point out that the
hardware isn't behaving as expected.

Well the static checker is not wrong - but the situation where this
could happen is if the hardware (or firmware running on the hardware)
breaks the contract of the specification. I'll put it on my todo list to
take a look at handling this more gracefully, but it's likely to take a
while before it bubbles to the top. But thanks for pointing out the issue.
