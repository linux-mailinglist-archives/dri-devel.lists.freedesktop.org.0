Yeah, but in graphics there's a wide band where "shit performance" is
defacto "not useable (as intended at least)".

So if we limit the symlink idea to just making sure zero-copy access is
possible, then we might not actually solve the real world problem we need
to solve. And so the symlinks become somewhat useless, and we need to
somewhere encode which flags you need to use with each symlink.

But I also see the argument that there's a bit a combinatorial explosion
possible. So I guess the question is where we want to handle it ...

Also wondering whether we should get the symlink/allocator idea off the
ground first, but given that that hasn't moved in a decade it might be too
much. But then the question is, what userspace are we going to use for all
these new heaps (or heaps with new flags)?

Cheers, Sima
