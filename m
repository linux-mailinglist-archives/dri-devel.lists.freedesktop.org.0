--- Comment #156 from Tom B <tom@r.je> ---
This is strange because with a patched 5.3.1, I have perfect stability. An
uptime of over a week and no issues. Are you saying that the issue comes ba=
ck
in 5.4? Hopefully not as Linux 5.4 + Mesa 19.3 looks to have a nice perform=
ance
bump on the VII.=20

With the patches, do you see the card boosting correctly? Do the wattage,
voltage and clocks change under load? Asking an obvious question here, but =
is
the crash temperature related? Maybe the patches increase power and overhea=
t.
If so, it might explain why I'm not affected as my card is water cooled.
