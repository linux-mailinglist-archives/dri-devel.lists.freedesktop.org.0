Even this `NoKms` type seems a bit better than just PhantomData, =
although ideally
others could chime in with a better solution.

IMHO, the problem is that you=E2=80=99re adding extra semantics on top =
of a fairly well-known type.

=46rom PhantomData=E2=80=99s docs:

```
Zero-sized type used to mark things that =E2=80=9Cact like=E2=80=9D they =
own a T.

Adding a PhantomData<T> field to your type tells the compiler that your =
type
acts as though it stores a value of type T, even though it doesn=E2=80=99t=
 really. This information
is used when computing certain safety properties.
```

This just isn=E2=80=99t what is going on here.

Anyways, that=E2=80=99s just my opinion, maybe wait for more feedback so =
that you don=E2=80=99t
change things back and forth needlessly.
