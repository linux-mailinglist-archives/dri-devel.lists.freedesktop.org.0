Hello,

Here are 2 fixes and one improvement for the page fault handling. Those
bugs were found while working on indirect draw supports which requires
the allocation of a big heap buffer for varyings, and the vertex/tiler
shaders seem to have access pattern that trigger those issues. I
remember discussing the first issue with Steve or Robin a while back,
but we never hit it before (now we do :)).

The last patch is a perf improvement: no need to re-enable hardware
interrupts if we know the threaded irq handler will be woken up right
away.

Regards,

Boris

Changes in v2:
* Rework the MMU irq handling loop to avoid a goto

Boris Brezillon (3):
  drm/panfrost: Clear MMU irqs before handling the fault
  drm/panfrost: Don't try to map pages that are already mapped
  drm/panfrost: Stay in the threaded MMU IRQ handler until we've handled
    all IRQs
