--- Comment #30 from mnrzk@protonmail.com ---
I've been looking at this bug for a while now and I'll try to share what I've
found about it.

In some conditions, when amdgpu_dm_atomic_commit_tail calls
dm_atomic_get_new_state, dm_atomic_get_new_state returns a struct
dm_atomic_state* with an garbage context pointer.

I've also found that this bug exclusively occurs when commit_work is on the
workqueue. After forcing drm_atomic_helper_commit to run all of the commits
without adding to the workqueue and running the OS, the issue seems to have
disappeared. The system was stable for at least 1.5 hours before I manually
shut it down (meanwhile it has usually crashed within 30-45 minutes).

Perhaps there's some sort of race condition occurring after commit_work is
queued?
