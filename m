And yes.

Yes, and not. Devres cleans up the resources on "that" device, where 
that device is the dsi_device. But that is _not_ the one where we 
registered the resources.

No, the i2c client device is the "dsi peripheral device". Say, a DSI 
video mode panel that is controlled via i2c. Or ti-sn65dsi86.c bridge 
(that one actually uses a auxiliary_device so it's a bit more complex).

Yes. The devm_mipi_dsi_* functions register the resources (in this case, 
the dsi_device itself and the dsi attach) to the i2c client device's devres.

That is what my patch does.

But, as Sima replied, there's much more to this. I'll try to look at 
this at some point, but, unfortunately, no customer so far (as far as my 
memory serves) has ever been interested in module unloading or unbinding 
the devices, so... not very high in the todo list =).
