I don't think the part about leaking is true...

...because dma_fence_get_rcu_safe apears to be about whether the 
*pointer* to the fence itself is rcu protected, not about the fence 
object itself.

If one has a stable pointer to a fence dma_fence_get_rcu is I think 
enough to deal with SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU used by i915_request (as dma 
fence is a base object there). Unless you found a bug in rq field 
recycling. But access to the dma fence is all tightly controlled so I 
don't get what leaks.

According to the rationale behind SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU traditional RCU 
freeing can be a lot more costly so I think we need a clear 
justification on why this change is being considered.
