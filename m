Yes, you are right. The "clock-divider-oldi" does not propagate the
clk_set_rate() to the parent.

The actual parent clock is now owned by the oldi bridge driver, and that
is what sets the clock rate (7 * pixel freq). The equivalent action from
tidss vp (DRM crtc) is a no op in cases of OLDI display pipeline.

Usually, the DRM crtc is enabled first, before _any_ of the DRM bridges
get pre_enabled or enabled.

Since, OLDI is a DRM bridge, the OLDI enable (and by extension the
actual clk_set_rate()) takes place _after_ the DRM crtc has been
enabled (which is why you see the parent being set later on).

DRM crtc enable is where tidss vp attempts (and fails) to set the clock
rate, causing the warning you see initially.


I have attempted to re-order the bridge pre_enable and crtc enable calls
in these patches[0], separately.

While you have mentioned that you did add the prerequisites, could you
confirm that you applied the (now older) dependency patch mentioned in
the v4 cover-letter[1]?
Ideally, you should not observe these concerns if [1] were successfully
applied.

More importantly, if you are already on latest linux-next, I would
request you to use v6 of this OLDI series[2], along with the latest
dependency patches[0], as the older dependency patch is simply not
applicable on latest kernel anymore! =)

I'd appreciate it if you are able to test the latest revisions on your
single-link setup, and report back any issue you see! Thank you! =)
