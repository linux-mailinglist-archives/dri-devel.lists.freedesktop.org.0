I have taken a closer look and usb_bulk_msg() calls usb_start_wait_urb()
which uses wait_for_completion_timeout() so the timeout isn't handled by
the hardware.

usb_sg_wait() on the other hand uses plain wait_for_completion() without
the timeout. So ideally usb_sg_wait() should have had a timeout
parameter and used wait_for_completion_timeout().

I have looked at what the others are using:
- rtsx_usb uses 10 seconds in one place
- vub300 uses 2 seconds plus a length based addition
- usbtest uses 10 seconds.

The other USB DRM driver gm12u320 uses a 1 second timeout per block, so
a worst case timeout of 20 seconds per frame.

3 seconds is a "long time", but compared to the default control request
timeout USB_CTRL_GET_TIMEOUT which is 5 seconds, and which gud uses,
it's not that long. I don't want to put too much limitation on the
device, but ofc can't allow it to hang the driver.

And a timeout is an exception so hitting that probably means something
is seriously wrong. I though of adding some kind of usb bus reset
handling to the driver that kicks in after the device has been
unresponsive for some time, but dropped that since I have so limited
understanding of things USB.
