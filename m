Add a way to hint to the fence signaler of an upcoming deadline, such as
vblank, which the fence waiter would prefer not to miss.  This is to aid
the fence signaler in making power management decisions, like boosting
frequency as the deadline approaches and awareness of missing deadlines
so that can be factored in to the frequency scaling.

v2: Drop dma_fence::deadline and related logic to filter duplicate
    deadlines, to avoid increasing dma_fence size.  The fence-context
    implementation will need similar logic to track deadlines of all
    the fences on the same timeline.  [ckoenig]
v3: Clarify locking wrt. set_deadline callback
v4: Clarify in docs comment that this is a hint
v5: Drop DMA_FENCE_FLAG_HAS_DEADLINE_BIT.
v6: More docs
v7: Fix typo, clarify past deadlines

+/**
+ * DOC: deadline hints
+ *
+ * In an ideal world, it would be possible to pipeline a workload sufficiently
+ * that a utilization based device frequency governor could arrive at a minimum
+ * frequency that meets the requirements of the use-case, in order to minimize
+ * power consumption.  But in the real world there are many workloads which
+ * defy this ideal.  For example, but not limited to:
+ *
+ * * Workloads that ping-pong between device and CPU, with alternating periods
+ *   of CPU waiting for device, and device waiting on CPU.  This can result in
+ *   devfreq and cpufreq seeing idle time in their respective domains and in
+ *   result reduce frequency.
+ *
+ * * Workloads that interact with a periodic time based deadline, such as double
+ *   buffered GPU rendering vs vblank sync'd page flipping.  In this scenario,
+ *   missing a vblank deadline results in an *increase* in idle time on the GPU
+ *   (since it has to wait an additional vblank period), sending a signal to
+ *   the GPU's devfreq to reduce frequency, when in fact the opposite is what is
+ *   needed.
+ *
+ * To this end, deadline hint(s) can be set on a &dma_fence via &dma_fence_set_deadline.
+ * The deadline hint provides a way for the waiting driver, or userspace, to
+ * convey an appropriate sense of urgency to the signaling driver.
+ *
+ * A deadline hint is given in absolute ktime (CLOCK_MONOTONIC for userspace
+ * facing APIs).  The time could either be some point in the future (such as
+ * the vblank based deadline for page-flipping, or the start of a compositor's
+ * composition cycle), or the current time to indicate an immediate deadline
+ * hint (Ie. forward progress cannot be made until this fence is signaled).
+ *
+ * Multiple deadlines may be set on a given fence, even in parallel.  See the
+ * documentation for &dma_fence_ops.set_deadline.
+ *
+ * The deadline hint is just that, a hint.  The driver that created the fence
+ * may react by increasing frequency, making different scheduling choices, etc.
+ * Or doing nothing at all.
