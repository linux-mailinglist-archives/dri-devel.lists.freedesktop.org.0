What is letting you think that we want to bypass open source requirements ?
Although the neural network firmware and userspace application are not yet
opensource, our intention is to develop a full open source stack.
Currently, we only support Mediatek APU (an Xtensa VP6) and we have to 
use closed source sotfware to execute inferences on the accelerator.
As far I know, there software stack similar to mesa where we could add
support of a new accelerator (this is also true for firmware).
That is actually what we would like to do. But this will take a lot of 
time and we consider this driver as a first (small) step.

To be honest, I don't know what would be required for training engines.
We only target accelerators for embedded device that usually only run 
inferences. In my opinion, this is 2 different use cases and I don't 
think we could address them in the same way.

This makes sense to me.

I wrote this series a long time ago and just rebased it recently.
I will take some time to see the in-flight work and see if that 
something I could start using.

We are currently stuck with closed source fimrware, userspace 
applications and toolchains (works with android and linux).
We are looking for a solution but implementing something will take some 
time.
