Hi Laurent.

I have now been through this impressive series of patches.
It is a nice series properly split into small readable chunks.
A few nits in a few patches - already sent by separate mails.

Patch 2,4,13 (with nits addressed):
Reviewed-by: Sam Ravnborg <sam@ravnborg.org>

Patch 1-20 (except the ones with r-b):
Acked-by: Sam Ravnborg <sam@ravnborg.org>

I have browsed the remaining omap related patches.
Everything looked good but as I am not familiar with the code
so I can have missed something obvious.

Hopefully we can soon have this series landed so we can start
working on top of the new bridge/connector handling.

I assume it will be applied direct to drm-misc-next, so we do not
have to wait extra time to get it.

	Sam
