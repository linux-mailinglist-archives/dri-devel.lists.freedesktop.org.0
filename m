There's a small window of opportunity during which the adjust_lru()
function can be called with a GEM refcount of zero from the TTM
eviction code. This results in a kernel BUG().

Ensure that we don't attempt to modify the GEM shrinker lists unless
we have a GEM refcount.

Fixes: ebd4a8ec7799 ("drm/i915/ttm: move shrinker management into adjust_lru")
