Another good reason to go with full heap names instead of opaque flags on
existing heaps is that with the former we can use symlinks in sysfs to
specify heaps, with the latter we need a new idea. We haven't yet gotten
around to implement this anywhere, but it's been in the dma-buf/heap todo
since forever, and I like it as a design approach. So would be a good idea
to not toss it. With that display would have symlinks to cma-ecc and cma,
and rendering maybe cma-ecc, shmem, cma heaps (in priority order) for a
SoC where the display needs contig memory for scanout.

I think one option might be to just start using these internally, but not
sure the dma-api would understand a fallback cadence of allocators (afaik
you can specify specific cma regions already, but that doesn't really
covere the case where you can fall back to pages and iommu to remap to
contig dma space) ... And I don't think abandonding the dma-api for
allocating cma buffers is going to be a popular proposal.
