FWIW, a couple more alternatives:

5. Go/stay out of PSR while vblank interrupts are enabled (probably want to make sure vblankoffdelay is set up such that vblank interrupts are disabled ASAP)
6. Use fallback timers for vblank events while in PSR (there might be some infrastructure for this, since some drivers don't have real vblank interrupts)

Yeah, that's pretty likely to cause issues with existing real-world user space.
