i believe, was suggested earlier to directly expose the main function, isÂ 
there any reason to have a __ version ?

IIUC, the ownership of drm_dev_get is with devm_drm_dev_alloc
and the release is tied to a devm action hence we needed this.

in our case post tFLR we need to reprobe the device, but the previousdrm instance
is not destroyed with just calling pci_remove as it is tied to PDEV lifetime
which is not destroyed hence we need to call the last release action ourself
so that the final release is called.

the display side error is due to power wells, post FLR the power wells are already
disabled while we try to disable them from driver again it is throwing warnings.
