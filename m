Jordan,

as per my understanding this size rounding up to 2MB is for the VMA mapping,
not for the buffer size. 

Even if we drop this rounding up of vma size to 2MB but align the VMA
start to 2MB address then also this should be fine. Becasue the remaining of the
last PDE(2MB) will never be used for any other GTT mapping as the
starting addr wont align to 2MB.

Bob, Is the above understanding is right? if so could we drop the
requirement of mapping the vma size to 2MB?
