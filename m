One problem with this approach is that even if a buffer is originally created in / intended for local VRAM of a dGPU, it may get temporarily migrated to system RAM for other reasons, e.g. to make room for other buffers in VRAM. While it resides in system RAM, importing into another device with DRM_PRIME_FD_TO_HANDLE_NO_MOVE will work, but will result in pinning the buffer to system RAM, even though this isn't optimal for the intended buffer usage.

In other words, the new flag only gives the compositor information about the current state, not about the intention of the client. Another mechanism like https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/merge_requests/268 is needed for the latter.

So while this flag might be useful to prevent unintended buffer migration in some cases, it can't solve all multi-GPU issues for compositors.
