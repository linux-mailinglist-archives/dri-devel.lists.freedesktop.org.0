Yeah - in KMS we absolutely do allow for some variants of types where we do=
n't
know the specific driver implementation. We usually classify these as "Opaq=
ue"
types, and we make it so that they can be used identically to their fully-
typed variants with the exception that they don't allow for any private dri=
ver
data to be accessed and force the user to do a fallible upcast for that.

FWIW: Rust is actually great at this sort of thing thanks to trait magic, b=
ut
trying to go all the way up to a straight C pointer isn't really needed for
that and I don't recommend it. Using raw pointers in any public facing
interface where it isn't needed is just going to remove a lot of the benefi=
ts
from using rust in the first place. It might work, but if we're losing half
the safety we wanted to get from using rust then what's the point?

FWIW:=C2=A0
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/lyudess/linux/-/blob/rvkms-wip/rust/kernel/d=
rm/kms/crtc.rs?ref_type=3Dheads

Along with some of the other files in that folder have an example of how we=
're
handling stuff like this in KMS. Note that we still don't really have any
places where we actually allow a user to use direct pointers in an interfac=
e.
You -can- get raw pointers, but no bindings will take it which means you ca=
n't
do anything useful with them unless you resort to unsafe code (so, perfect
:).=C2=A0

Note: It _technically_ does not do fallible upcasts properly at the moment =
due
to me not realizing that constants don't have a consistent memory address w=
e
can use for determining the full type of an object - but Gerry Guo is
currently working on making some changes to the #[vtable] macro that should
allow us to fix that.
