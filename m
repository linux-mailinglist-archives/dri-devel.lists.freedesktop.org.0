btw, I just executed a draft version of vkms targed on the ci, we do get 
the warning:

https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/helen.fornazier/linux/-/jobs/49156305#L623

I'm just not sure if tests would fail (since it is a warning) and it has 
a chance to be ignored if people don't look at the logs (unless if igt 
already handles that).

I still need to do some adjustments (it seems the tests is hanging 
somewhere and we got a timeout) but we should have vkms in drm ci soon.

Regards,
Helen
