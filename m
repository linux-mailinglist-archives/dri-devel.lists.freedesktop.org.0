checking for magic numbers and magic array indices at the same time is
very prone to breaking, as breaking this check would not at all be easy
to spot in code review.

Perhaps I'm biased towards keeping this kind of stuff out of the kernel,
but I'd say that Linux should decide on one logical path.

In between us starting this discussion, Qualcomm managed to introduce
yet another way of deciding what GPU is present on the system in their
downstream driver[1]. We're at like 5 now. Do we wanna keep up each time?
New ID rework for A8xx when that comes out one day?

Yeah I'd like to get a7xx landed this season..

Konrad

[1] they now read parts of socinfo from smem and decide the CHIPID and
    speedbin based on that, but it's not available on most existing SoCs,
    that was thrown in with SOCID v17
