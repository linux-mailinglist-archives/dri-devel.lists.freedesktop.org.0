I think that is marking the object with I915_BO_ALLOC_VOLATILE. However
I assume this follows the rule of the internal backend objects:
Contents are valid while pinned (or locked), and these images are
indeed pinned on suspend so we need to come up with something else.
Perhaps I915_BO_ALLOC_PM_NOSAVE for the context images (and engine
status pages?) I915_BO_ALLOC_PM_MEMCPY for the migrate vm pagetables
only. The latter will come in handy also for supporting small apertures
where we need to pin these in the mappable area.

My current WIP backs them up. But with something like the above flags,
that's easily changed. Suggestions welcome.
