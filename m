If a quirk is introduced possibly leading to higher power consumption, 
especially on systems nobody has access to yet, then the detail, where 
the system hangs/freezes is not unreasonable at all.

In the Linux logs from the issue there are messages like

     [   58.101385] Freezing of tasks failed after 20.003 seconds (4 
tasks refusing to freeze, wq_busy=0):

     [   78.278403] Freezing of tasks failed after 20.008 seconds (4 
tasks refusing to freeze, wq_busy=0):

and it looks like several suspend/resume cycles were done.

I see a lot of commit messages over the whole Linux kernel, where this 
level of detail is provided (by default), and

The second question was not for the commit message, but just for 
documentation purpose when the problem is going to be fixed properly. 
And it looks like (at least publicly) analyzing the root cause is not 
happening, and once the quirk lands, nobody is going to feel the 
pressure to work on it, as everyoneâ€™s plates are full.


Kind regards,

Paul
