Hi Christian,

We have some mapping requirements that I was hoping I could address by mapping
these pages manually.

Are you sure that it's illegal to access the underlying pages of an exported
DMA-BUF? There appears to be quite a few usages of this already. See the usage
of drm_prime_sg_to_page_addr_arrays() in vgem, vkms, msm, xen, and etnaviv.
drm_gem_prime_import_dev() uses driver->gem_prime_import_sg_table() when
importing a DMA-BUF from another driver, and the listed drivers then extract the
pages from the given SGT using drm_prime_sg_to_page_addr_arrays(). These pages
can then be mapped and faulted in.

See commit af33a9190d02 ('drm/vgem: Enable dmabuf import interfaces'). After
importing the pages from the SGT, vgem can fault them in, taking a refcount with
get_page() first. get_page() throws a BUG if the refcount is zero, which it will
hit on each of the 'tail' pages from TTM THP allocations. 

All of this currently works fine with TTM DMA-BUFs when the kernel is built with
!CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE. However, 'echo never >
/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled' doesn't change how TTM allocates
pages.

Understood, I figured something like that was the case, so I wanted to get your
input first. Do you know what the problems were, exactly? Practical issues
aside, it seems strange to call something a transparent huge page if it's
non-compound.

Besides making these pages compound, would it be reasonable to split them before
sharing them, in e.g. amdgpu_dma_buf_map (and in other drivers that use TTM)?
That's where it's supposed to make sure that the shared DMA-BUF is accessible by
the target device.

Thanks,
Alex
