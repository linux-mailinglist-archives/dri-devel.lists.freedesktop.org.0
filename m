Currently, the software simply selects the first available port. So if 
user plugs in DP dongles in both USB-C ports, the DP driver will select 
the first port. This process is implemented in cdn_dp_connected_port() .

Yes.Â  What you mentioned is the case in 
drivers/usb/typec/altmodes/displayport.c . I have also added a new OOB 
event notify in the PHY driver in Patch 3, where the expected fwnode is 
used in the PHY. So now we have two OOB HPD events, one from 
altmodes/displayport.c and the other from PHY. Only the HPD from PHY is 
eventually passed to the DP driver.
