--- Comment #52 from dimitris@gmail.com ---
This is a shot in the dark/cargo culting it, but in case it helps:

I had a very similar problem on a T495 (Ryzen 3700U), running Fedora 31, which
resolved itself when the 5.4 series was available in Fedora.

Before 5.4 was available, I came across reports linking this to a USB
controller of all things, like
https://www.mail-archive.com/debian-kernel@lists.debian.org/msg116563.html.

In my case the cuprit was:

06:00.4 USB controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD] Raven USB 3.1

so I started removing the device from the PCI tree before suspend using
/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:06:00.4/remove and rescanning the PCI bus on resume. 
First manually and later though a systemd hook.  That worked around the problem
until 5.4 "fixed" this.
