Ok, I'll give it a try.

I have now prepared the patchset, generated a key and can now do:
b4 send -o

The first thing that strikes me is that everyone mentioned in one of the
patches get the entire patchset, even stable@vger.kernel.org (cc'ed in a
fixes patch). The first patch touches a core file and as a result a few
drivers, so I've cc'ed the driver maintainers in that patch, but now
they get the entire patchset where 5 of 6 patches is about a driver that
I maintain. So from their point of view, they see a patchset about a
driver they don't care about and a patch touching a core file, but from
the subject it's not apparent that it touches their driver. I'm afraid
that this might result in none of them looking at that patch. In this
particular case it's not that important, but in another case it might be.

As for the setting up the web endpoint, should I just follow the b4 docs
on that?

I use b4 version 0.10.1, is that recent enough?

Noralf.
