I'd be quite keen for the "fork" to live in the upstream kernel. My
preference is for the two drivers to sit side-by-side. I'm not sure
whether that's a common view though.

Agreed, there's not much you can drop and still have a useful driver.

I think here's an important issues: what do we do about users who for
whatever reason don't have a Rust toolchain for their kernel build? Do
we really expect that the "other dependencies" are going to take so long
to upstream that everyone who wants this driver will have a Rust toolchain?

If we're adding new features (devcoredump) it's reasonable to say you
don't get the feature unless you have Rust[1]. If we're converting
existing functionality that's a different matter (it's a clear regression).

Having a separate code base for the Rust Panthor sidesteps the problem,
but does of course allow the two drivers to diverge. I don't have a good
solution.

[1] Although I have to admit for a debugging feature like devcoredump
there might well be pressure to implement this in C as well purely so
that customer issues can be debugged...

Well I'd hope that there's some benefit to Rust as a language, and that
therefore it's easier to write cleaner code. Not least that in theory
there's no need to review for memory safety outside of unsafe code. I
expect I'll retire before my Rust experience exceeds my C experience
even if I never touch C again!
