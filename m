I understood you were dropping this from the series but now that I 
noticed it all landed I realized you probably meant something else.

I think it's not ideal that you repeatedly ignored my comments to have a 
cover letter and not mix independent work in the same series. I am 
pretty sure this exact mode of operation was quite frowned upon, to put 
it mildly, not so long ago.

If I need to be explicit - large series doing multiple things, with no 
cover letter giving overview, plus merging with outstanding opens.

As I was not expecting this would go in so quick, I did not even read 
the whole series yet.

Even on the most prosaic level I even disagree with putting execbuf in 
the helper name which gets the VM from a GEM context. Proof in the 
pudding is that you have non-execbuf parts of the driver using this helper.
