Hm, this could be tricky. So mmu operations shouldn't be an issue because
they must work for GFP_NOFS contexts for i/o writeback. You might need to
much more carefully manage this and make sure the iommu has big enough
range of pagetables preallocated. This also holds for the other games
we're playing here, at least for gpu pagetables. But since pagetables are
really small overhead it might be good to somewhat aggressively
preallocate them.

But yeah this is possible an issue if you you need iommu wrangling, I
have honestly not looked at the exact rules in there.
