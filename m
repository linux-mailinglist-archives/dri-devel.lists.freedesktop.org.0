Hi Helen,

Great to see this coming to the DRM!

Just wondering, any chance we could add a stage to perform tests on
VKMS? The main way of validating VKMS is through IGT tests, so I feel
it would be a perfect match to have VKMS as a stage on the CI. As a
generic KMS driver, VKMS is also great to validate changes on DRM core.

Another question, could we add V3D to the default arm and arm64 config?

Best Regards,
- MaÃ­ra
