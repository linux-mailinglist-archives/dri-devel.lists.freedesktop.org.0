Enter "continue" (or just "c") at the gdb prompt to continue, and wait for a
few breakpoint hits, to see if they're getting hit from multiple places.

Also, make sure debugging symbols are available for
/usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers/amdgpu_drv.so (and ideally also for Xorg and =
its
modules), otherwise the backtraces are useless.
