Possible bug fix #1

(In reply to mnrzk from comment #87)
> Good news, I wrote a patch that fixed this bug on my machine and submitted

> 
> I've tested this for almost 12 hours with KASAN enabled and 3 hours with
> all debugging options disabled while watching videos and there have been no
> crashes. The longest it's taken for the bug to occur in the past for me was

For convenience, I'll attach the patch here as well.
