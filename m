Hi. I'm the maintainer of chromebooks (including exynos 5 ones) in 
postmarketOS.

We are indeed on 6.1.24 yet, but we will upgrade it to the latest LTS soon.

The recommended way to build kernel is envkernel, see

https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Compiling_kernels_with_envkernel.sh. 
This way you can build kernel, package it and sideload it to your 
device, so it will get installed including updating /lib/modules and 
flashing chrome os kernel partition.

You would need to source envkernel.sh in your kernel tree, place kernel 
config at .output/.config, build it and perform:
pmbootstrap build --envkernel linux-postmarketos-exynos5
pmbootstrap sideload --install-key --host <ip> linux-postmarketos-exynos5

We use lts branch of https://gitlab.com/exynos5-mainline/linux with this 
config:

https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/-/blob/master/device/community/linux-postmarketos-exynos5/config-postmarketos-exynos5.armv7
