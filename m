IMHO it would be better to limit /dev/rgbledstring use to only
cases where direct userspace control is not possible and thus
have the cut be based on whether direct userspace control
(e.g. /dev/hidraw access) is possible or not.

Ah good point, no I think that a basic driver just for kbd backlight
brightness support which works with the standard desktop environment
controls for this makes sense.

Combined with some mechanism for e.g. openrgb to fully take over
control as discussed. It is probably a good idea to file a separate
issue with the openrgb project to discuss the takeover API.

Great, thank you.
