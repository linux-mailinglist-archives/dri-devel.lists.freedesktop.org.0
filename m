--- Comment #74 from Nicholas Kazlauskas <nicholas.kazlauskas@amd.com> ---

Even if it's no-op update it's still going to be locking the connector and
potentially blocking other commits from occurring so ideally the client
userspace wouldn't be dong this.

I can try writing up a patch that doesn't lock everything if the connector
state hasn't change at the very least but I'm not sure if it will fully add=
ress
the issue or not.
