+================
+DRM Device Reset
+================
+
+The GPU stack is really complex and is prone to errors, from hardware bugs,
+faulty applications and everything in the many layers in between. To recover
+from this kind of state, sometimes is needed to reset the GPU. Unproper handling
+of GPU resets can lead to an unstable userspace. This page describes what's the
+expected behaviour from DRM drivers to do in those situations, from usermode
+drivers and compositors as well.
+
+Robustness
+----------
+
+First of all, application robust APIs, when available, should be used. This
+allows the application to correctly recover and continue to run after a reset.
+Apps that doesn't use this should be promptly killed when the kernel driver
+detects that it's in broken state. Specifically guidelines for some APIs:
+
+- OpenGL: During a reset, KMD kill processes that haven't ARB Robustness
+  enabled, assuming they can't recover.
+- Vulkan: Assumes that every app is able to deal with ``VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST``,
+  so KMD doesn't kill any. If it doesn't do it right, it's considered a broken
+  application and UMD will deal with it.
+
+Kernel mode driver
+------------------
+
+The KMD should be able to detect that something is wrong with the application
+and that a reset is needed to take place to recover the device (e.g. an endless
+wait). It needs to properly track the context that is broken and mark it as
+dead, so any other syscalls to that context should be further rejected. The
+other contexts should be preserved when possible, avoid crashing the rest of
+userspace. KMD can ban a file descriptor that keeps causing resets, as it's
+likely in a broken loop.
+
+User mode driver
+----------------
+
+During a reset, UMD should be aware that rejected syscalls indicates that the
+context is broken and for robust apps the recovery should happen for the
+context. Non-robust apps would be already terminated by KMD. If no new context
+is created for some time, it is assumed that the recovery didn't work, so UMD
+should terminate it.
+
+Compositors
+-----------
+
+(In the long term) compositors should be robust as well to properly deal with it
+errors. Init systems should be aware of the compositor status and reset it if is
+broken.
