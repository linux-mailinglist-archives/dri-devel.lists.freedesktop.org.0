--- Comment #6 from Sylvain BERTRAND (sylvain.bertrand@gmail.com) ---
Owner and user of tahiti parts on amdgpu with a state of the art gfx stack
poping in.

I own "rise of the tomb raider" which gnu/linux port is vulkan only, and vulkan
is only available with the "amdgpu" kernel module (as far as I know).

I have not bought "shadow of the tomb raider", which is vulkan only too (the
port was coded by the same company).

I did clear "rise of the tomb raider" years ago, I cannot play it anymore
because the driver seems to miscompile some shaders and does gpu vm faults
(from my save file). I did open a bug.

I heard 'southern islands' parts (tahiti...) do suffer from a critical "mip
mapping" slowdown bug. That could explain the slugginesh of those hardware
parts in 3d intense games (I did almost stop playing "rise of the tomb raider"
because the 3d rendering was unpleasantly not smooth enough).

If you want, we can try to compare our benchmarks?
