Ah, of course, I wasn't thinking. It's a DSI panel (obviously...), so it 
doesn't have sync polarities and as such it doesn't really make sense to 
define them in the panel-simple.c.

But we still need an agreed sync polarity between the tegra and the 
tc358768, as that is a parallel video bus. And that polarity is not 
defined anywhere, as it is expected to come from the panel.

Maybe tc358768 should have a mode-fixup, where it sets the polarities if 
they are not defined? I'll have to look at this a bit more.
