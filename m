It looks odd to me that this patch removes lines that were added in
patch 1/3. Maybe you could change the patchset order and place this one
as the first.

I believe it would be "struct dma_fence".

Would it be possible to add a comment that `run_job()` must check if
`s_fence->finished.error` is different than 0? If you increase the karma
of a job and don't check for `s_fence->finished.error`, you might run a
cancelled job.

A suggestion: "the fence that the driver must signal once the hardware
has completed the job".
