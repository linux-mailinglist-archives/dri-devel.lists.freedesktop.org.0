I am not saying it is, was just unsure and wanted some people who worked on this code most recently to take a look and confirm.

I guess it will work since the copying is done like this anyway:

		/*
		 * This is the fast path and we cannot handle a pagefault
		 * whilst holding the struct mutex lest the user pass in the
		 * relocations contained within a mmaped bo. For in such a case
		 * we, the page fault handler would call i915_gem_fault() and
		 * we would try to acquire the struct mutex again. Obviously
		 * this is bad and so lockdep complains vehemently.
		 */
		pagefault_disable();
		copied = __copy_from_user_inatomic(r, urelocs, count * sizeof(r[0]));
		pagefault_enable();
		if (unlikely(copied)) {
			remain = -EFAULT;
			goto out;
		}

Comment is a bit outdated since we don't use that global "struct mutex" any longer, but in any case, if there is a page fault on the mapping where we need to recurse into i915 again to satisfy if, we seem to have code already to handle it. So kmap_local conversion I *think* can't regress anything.

Patch to convert the io_mapping_map_atomic_wc can indeed come later.

In terms of logistics - if we landed this series to out branch it would be queued only for 6.5. Would that work for you?

Tvrtko
