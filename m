--- Comment #3 from Stefan Rehm <stefan@rehm.email> ---
I can confirm this. My card is a PowerColor Radeon RX 5700 XT Red Dragon. As
soon as I connect a second monitor, I get the same errors in dmesg as Timur
Krist=C3=B3f described. Unfortunately, the workaround with the HDMI connect=
ion does
not seem to work in my case. It does not matter wether the monitors are
connected via DP or HDMI.

One important fact: the problem started with kernel 5.4-rc1 and persists in
5.4-rc2, but 5.3 works fine (except for the problem with the high idle power
consumption, but that is a different story :))!
