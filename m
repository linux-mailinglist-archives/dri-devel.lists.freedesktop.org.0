By asking that I don't want to say I'm against this idea, I'm just 
wondering how it becomes easier to deal with "tons of hw specific 
requirements" by generalizing things even more?

What makes us think that we do a better job in considering all hw 
specific requirements with a unified UAPI than with a more lightweight 
generic component for tracking VA mappings?

Also, wouldn't we need something like the GPUVA manager as part of a 
unified UAPI?

Not entirely. Let's assume userspace creates two virtually contiguous 
buffers (VKBuffer) A and B. Userspace could bind a BO with BO offset 0 
to A (binding 1) and afterwards bind the same BO with BO offset 
length(A) to B (binding 2), maybe unlikely but AFAIK not illegal.

If we don't know about the bounds of A and B in the kernel, we detect 
that both bindings are virtually and physically contiguous and we merge 
them.

In the best case this was simply useless, because we'll need to split 
them anyway later on when A or B is destroyed, but in the worst case we 
could fault the GPU, e.g. if merging leads to a change of the page 
tables that are backing binding 1, but buffer A is already in use by 
userspace.

In Nouveau, I think we could also get rid of regions and do something 
driver specific for the handling of the dual page tables, which I want 
to use for sparse regions *and* just don't merge (at least for now). But 
exactly for the sake of not limiting drivers in their HW specifics I 
thought it'd be great if merging is supported in case it makes sense for 
a specific HW, especially given the fact that memory sizes are increasing.
