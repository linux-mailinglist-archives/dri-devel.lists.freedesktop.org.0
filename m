"Maintainer" would be an overstatement. I've worked on that driver in
the past, and I still use it, but don't have time to really maintain it.
I've also been told that Synopsys required all patches for that driver
developed using documentation under NDA to be submitted internally to
them first before being published, so I decided to stop contributing
instead of agreeing with this insane process. There's public
documentation about the IP in some NXP reference manuals though, so it
should be possible to still move forward without abiding by this rule.

I haven't followed the ful conversation, what the reason why
DRM_BRIDGE_ATTACH_NO_CONNECTOR can't always be use here ? We're moving
towards requiring DRM_BRIDGE_ATTACH_NO_CONNECTOR for all new code, so it
will have to be done eventually.
