FWIW, nothing prevents io_uring from compressing ranges. The io_uring
zc RFC returns {offset, size} as well, though at the moment the would
lie in the same page.

If you mean async io_uring recv, it does work. In short, internally
it polls the socket and then calls sock_recvmsg(). There is also a
feature that would make it return back to polling after sock_recvmsg()
and loop like this.
