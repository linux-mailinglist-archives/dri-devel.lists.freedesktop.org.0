This was undercounted, 1050/s is actually only for when two or more 
fences are in the input array. Therefore the number of "raw" calls is 
much higher, around 2x more according to these percentages, or even more 
for Hogwarths. Which I guess strengthens the argument for the single 
fence fast path from the previous patch.

Fixes: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/3617

It should at least.
