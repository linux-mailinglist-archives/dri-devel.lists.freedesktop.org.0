--- Comment #22 from Christian Zigotzky <chzigotzky@xenosoft.de> ---
Edit: typo

Again. Did you modify the behaviour of the initialisation of two graphics c=
ards
in the DRM updates 'drm-next-2018-12-14'? If you say no, then I can look in=
 the
PowerPC updates. You need to know if there was a change or you don't know w=
hat
you published. It's not the task for the enduser to look in your code or bi=
sect
the code because you don't know the changes. It is always the same. You cha=
nged
the code and after that we have issues and we endusers and first level supp=
ort
have to figure out where the problem is. And if we don't figure out the iss=
ue
then the issue remains. It's easy to write that you don't have this platfor=
m.
