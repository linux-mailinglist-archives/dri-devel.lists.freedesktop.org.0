--- Comment #63 from Duncan (1i5t5.duncan@cox.net) ---
(In reply to Duncan from comment #62)

NB: The 3202fa62f followups are cbfc35a48 and 89b83f282.  That should let
anyone else with git and kernel building skills try reverting the three.

Still too early (by days) to call it nailed down as I've had it take 2-3 days
to trigger, but no gfx freeze here yet on that v5.8-rc5+ with 320-and-followups
reverted so far, despite playing 4k video to try to trigger it as it has
previously on affected kernels.  I'll be trying update builds (gentoo) later
today or tomorrow, another previous trigger, so we'll see how it goes.

But initial results are good enough to let others know that may want to try
it...
