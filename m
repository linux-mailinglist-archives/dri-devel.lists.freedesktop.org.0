Hi Bartosz, Krzysztof, Matt

Thanks for the detailed explanation. I understand and agree with your
point about using existing device tree links. The pwrseq framework's
design makes perfect sense, and matching via the power-domains property
is the right way forward for the provider.

Just to clarify, my intention is to add the power-domains check to my
existing .match() function, which already validates the consumer's
compatible ("thead,th1520-gpu"). Combining these two checks will create
an even stronger, more specific match. I will proceed with this change.

However, this leads me back to a fundamental issue with the
consumer side implementation in the generic pvr_device.c driver. The
current fallback code is:

/*
 * If the error is -EPROBE_DEFER, it's because the
 * optional sequencer provider is not present
 * and it's safe to fall back on manual power-up.
 */
if (pwrseq_err == -EPROBE_DEFER)
        pvr_dev->pwrseq = NULL;

As Krzysztof noted, simply ignoring -EPROBE_DEFER is not ideal. But if I
change this to a standard deferred probe, the pvr_device.c driver will
break on all other supported SoCs. It would wait indefinitely for a
pwrseq-thead-gpu provider that will never appear on those platforms.

The core of the problem is that any solution within the provider's
.match() function cannot help here. On other SoCs, the
pwrseq-thead-gpu.c driver is not even compiled, so its .match() function
will never be executed. The generic consumer driver needs a way to know
whether it should even attempt to get a sequencer.

This brings me back to the idea of a DT property, and I'd like to frame
it from a different perspective. A property like needs-power-sequencer
(perhaps vendor-prefixed as thead,needs-power-sequencer) isn't meant to
describe driver behavior, but rather to describe a physical integration
requirement of the hardware.

For the TH1520, the SoC integrators made a design choice that mandates a
specific software driven power on sequence. On other supported SoCs, as
noted by the Imagination developers [1], this sequencing is handled by
the hardware itself. Describing this platform specific requirement this
hardware quirk in the DT seems to be the most accurate way to model the
physical reality.

What would be the recommended way to proceed? The generic consumer
driver needs a way to know if it should expect a sequencer for a
particular platform, and the DT seems like the most appropriate place to
describe this hardware specific need.

If a DT property remains unacceptable, the only other path I can see is
a minimal change to the core pwrseq API itself, perhaps by adding a
non deferring devm_pwrseq_try_get() function.
