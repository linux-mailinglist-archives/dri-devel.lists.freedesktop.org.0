Yeah so maybe a bit more detail on my thoughts:

First this smells like a need bypass of the entire "we want open userspace
for accel drivers" rule. The rule isn't quite a strict as for drm gpu
drivers (not sure we ended up documenting exactly what, but iirc the
consensus was that for build-time only dependencies we're ok with
downstream compilers), but it's still there.

And at least from a quick look apu.ko and libapu just look like a generic
accel interface, and that's not enough.

For the big training engines it's more or less "enough to run pytorch, but
it can be really slow", not sure what the right standard for these
inference-only drivers should be.

So that's the first reason why I don't like this.

The other is that I think if we do end up with a pile of tiny accel
drivers, we should probably look into something like simmpledrm for the
tiny display drivers. Probably still IP specific ioctls (at least most) so
that IP specific job knows and all that are easy, but then just pass to a
framework that simplifies a drm gem driver to "write ptes" and "run job"
callback, maybe with an optional "create/destroy vm/ctx" for hw which can
do that.

So maybe we end up with a drivers/accel/tiny and a bunch more helpers
around the existing gem ones. The rule we have for drm/tiny is "1 file,
less than 1kloc", and there's a bunch of them. I do think we can achieve
the same for tiny accel inference engines (but it's still a bit a road).
Maybe tiny accel is more like "less than 5kloc" since you need a bit more
glue for the driver specific ioctl stuff - maybe that's only needed for
the submit ioctl, maybe also for buffer map/unmap and creation.

Also note that there's an entire pile of in-flight work for adding new
helpers to the gem world to make this all easier. Once we have gpuva and
exec helpers there not much glue left to tie it all together with the
scheduler.

But the real crux is that an accel inference driver really needs to have
enough userspace to do an actual inference job with some
android/cros/whatever framework for inference (there's just too many).
