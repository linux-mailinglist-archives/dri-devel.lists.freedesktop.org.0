The linked line just means the property value itself not changing
doesn't result in a full compositor side monitor reconfiguration. A few
lines below it also checks whether the advertised modes changed in any
way, and if they did, trigger a monitor reconfiguration, so it's not
clear what is not working, since it should have done a full mode rescan,
and reconfigured everything if anything changed.
