AFAICS from the other mail thread it seems to be consensus to not 
ref-count entities and handle job statistics differently.

Should we go ahead and take this patch then? Maybe it also makes sense 
to send a V2 additionally adding a comment to the drm_sched_job 
structure mentioning that .entity must not be used after the job was 
taken from the entities queue.
