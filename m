Yeah the OpaqueFoo design is what I describe below (I think at least),
with some Deref magic so that you don't have to duplicate functions too
much (or the AsRawFoo trait you have). Well, except my OpaqueFoo does
_not_ have any generics, because that's the thing that gives you the pain
for partial driver conversions - there's just no way to create a T:
KmsDriver which isn't flat-out a lie breaking safety assumptions.

On second thought, I'm not sure AsRawFoo will work, since some of the
trait stuff piled on top might again make assumptions about other parts of
the driver also being in rust. So a concrete raw type that that's opaque
feels better for the api subset that's useable by mixed drivers. One
reason is that for this OpaqueFoo from_raw is not unsafe, because it makes
no assumption about the specific type, whereas from_raw for any other
implementation of AsRawFoo is indeed unsafe. But might just be wrong here.

Your OpaqueCrtc only leaves out the DriverCRTC generic, which might also
be an issue, but isn't the only one.

So kinda what you have, except still not quite.
