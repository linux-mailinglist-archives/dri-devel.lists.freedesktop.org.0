--- Comment #60 from MasterCATZ (mastercatz@hotmail.com) ---
seems a bit random for me 5.8.17-050817-generic 

sometimes I can spend weeks with fan control then all of a sudden I find it
hitting 100deg because it keeps spinning back down to 20% range 

for me this seems to happen when I am using multiple monitors, does not seem to
happen when using a single display however this could be related to memory
actually idling 


I will give your code a go and put it into auto mode , its summer here so
thermals are reached quickly I have GPU idling 300core 100 memory  @ 47.8%
manually this seems to keep it the same temp as the entire system 
just so the dreaded auto is not triggered or else memory goes 800 and fan drops
to 20's with the 100% blimps @ 95+ deg
