Per https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/weston/-/issues/514#note_986797 , IMO the underlying issue is actually that the guest compositor repaint cycle is not aligned with the host compositor one. If they were aligned, the problem would not occur even without allowing multiple page flips in flight, and latency would be lower.

I'd say there would definitely need to be some kind of signal for the display server that it should queue multiple flips, since this is normally not desirable for latency. In other words, this wouldn't really be useful on bare metal (in contrast to the ability to replace a pending flip with a newer one).
