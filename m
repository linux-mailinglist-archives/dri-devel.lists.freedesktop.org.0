Hmm, I understand but I'm not sure what is the best thing to do.

There also is the resolution check. So if a new "NEXT 2" is released
then this really only is an issue if it too uses a 800x1280 screen,
but then with its left-side-up.

If it uses a normal landscape 1280x800 screen the resolution won't
match the 800x1280 the quirk checks for so nothing happens.

If it again uses a 800x1280 portrait screen in landscape mode
with its right-side-up then the quirk matching actualy is
a good thing.

So the only bad scenario is a 800x1280 screen which is left-side-up,
which the quirk will then turn from being on its side to being
upside-down. The question then is though if upside-down is much
worse then on its side, neither is really usable, so we would
need a quirk for this screen then anyways...

So I understand where you are coming from, but I see the chances
of this becoming a problem as pretty small (and we can fix it
when it does happen). OTOH the dmi_system_id table we are
discussing is almost always built into the vmlinuz image.
So growing it will cause extra disk/RAM uses for every Linux
user out there (not just Aya Neo Next users).

So IMHO going with only using 1 entry with the small risc of
needing to revisit this later is the better solution here.

Regards,

Hans
