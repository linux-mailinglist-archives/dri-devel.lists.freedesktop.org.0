mm/slub.c set_freepointer() (via several possible paths through slab_free())
via writes the pointer. What you really want to know is "who called kfree()
before this tried to read from here?".

With CONFIG_SLAB_FREELIST_HARDENED=y the contents will be randomly permuted on
a per-slab basis. Without, they'll look like a "regular" kernel heap pointer
(0xffff....). You maybe have much more exciting failure modes without
CONFIG_SLAB_FREELIST_HARDENED since the pointer will actually be valid. :P
