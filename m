I think for this particular example we want to tie it to the pci::Bar on way or
the other.

But yes, the idea would be that any `dyn Io` works.

I think it's hard to predict to what extend we can (or want to) generalize this.
But I think those are good thoughts that should be considered working on this.

If you come up with a few lines to broaden the scope, I'm happy to add them to
this section.

I think we have to work out the advantages and disadvantages and see if there
are any opportunities for synergies.

For instance, in case we end up with separate VMM management in nova-core and
nova-drm, there might be synergies for the other options.

I think it is common understanding to have nova-core + vGPU as a first
milestone.

However, I think that we should also put some effort into the nova-drm side of
things to not miss out on potential design contraints on both ends, nova-core
<-> nova-drm as well as nova-drm <-> DRM core, since there are also other
upcoming Rust DRM drivers.

I'm a bit confused about who specifically is meant with "we", "the folks" and
"us" in your statements above.

But of course everyone is welcome to be involved into the aspects mentioned
above and the project in general. :-)

I think this will be very useful for nova project!

Yes, that's the idea. Is there anything additional you'd like to see added for
this initial commit?

You mean adding an explanation as for why to avoid "unsafe"? I thought it's
probably rather obvious.

But I'm also fine adding an explanation, suggestions?
