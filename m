Add the first version of the VM_BIND locking document which is
intended to be part of the xe driver upstreaming agreement.

The document describes and discuss the locking used during exec-
functions, evicton and for userptr gpu-vmas. Intention is to be using the
same nomenclature as the drm-vm-bind-async.rst.

v2:
- s/gvm/gpu_vm/g (Rodrigo Vivi)
- Clarify the userptr seqlock with a pointer to mm/mmu_notifier.c
  (Rodrigo Vivi)
- Adjust commit message accordingly.
- Add SPDX license header.

+VM_BIND locking
+===============
+
+This document attempts to describe what's needed to get VM_BIND locking right,
+including the userptr mmu_notifier locking and it will also discuss some
+optimizations to get rid of the looping through of all userptr mappings and
+external / shared object mappings that is needed in the simplest
+implementation. It will also discuss some implications for faulting gpu_vms.
+
+Nomenclature
+============
+
+* ``Context``: GPU execution context.
+* ``gpu_vm``: Abstraction of a virtual GPU address space with
+  meta-data. Typically one per client (DRM file-private), or one per
+  context.
+* ``gpu_vma``: Abstraction of a GPU address range within a gpu_vm with
+  associated meta-data. The backing storage of a gpu_vma can either be
+  a gem buffer object or anonymous pages mapped also into the CPU
+  address space for the process.
+* ``userptr gpu_vma or just userptr``: A gpu_vma, the backing store of
+  which is anonymous pages as described above.
+* ``revalidating``: Revalidating a gpu_vma means making the latest version
+  of the backing store resident and making sure the gpu_vma's
+  page-table entries point to that backing store.
+* ``dma_fence``: A struct dma_fence that is similar to a struct completion
+  and which tracks GPU activity. When the GPU activity is finished,
+  the dma_fence signals.
+* ``dma_resv``: A struct dma_resv (AKA reservation object) that is used
+  to track GPU activity in the form of multiple dma_fences on a
+  gpu_vm or a gem buffer object. The dma_resv contains an array / list
+  of dma_fences and a lock that needs to be held when adding
+  additional dma_fences to the dma_resv. The lock is of a type that
+  allows deadlock-safe locking of multiple dma_resvs in arbitrary order.
+* ``exec function``: An exec function is a function that revalidates all
+  affected gpu_vmas, submits a GPU command batch and registers the
+  dma_fence representing the GPU command's activity with all affected
+  dma_resvs. For completeness, although not covered by this document,
+  it's worth mentioning that an exec function may also be the
+  revalidation worker that is used by some drivers in compute /
+  long-running mode.
+* ``local object``: A GEM object which is local to a gpu_vm. Shared gem
+  objects also share the gpu_vm's dma_resv.
+* ``shared object``: AKA external object: A GEM object which may be shared
+  by multiple gpu_vms and whose backing storage may be shared with
+  other drivers.
+
+
+Introducing the locks
+=====================
+
+One of the benefits of VM_BIND is that local GEM objects share the gpu_vm's
+dma_resv object and hence the dma_resv lock. So even with a huge
+number of local GEM objects, only one lock is needed to make the exec
+sequence atomic.
+
+The following locks and locking orders are used:
+
+* The ``gpu_vm->lock`` (optionally an rwsem). Protects how the gpu_vm is
+  partitioned into gpu_vmas, protects the gpu_vm's list of external objects,
+  and can also with some simplification protect the gpu_vm's list of
+  userptr gpu_vmas. With the CPU mm analogy this would correspond to the
+  mmap_lock.
+* The ``userptr_seqlock``. This lock is taken in read mode for each
+  userptr gpu_vma on the gpu_vm's userptr list, and in write mode during mmu
+  notifier invalidation. This is not a real seqlock but described in
+  ``mm/mmu_notifier.c` as a "Collision-retry read-side/write-side
+  'lock' a lot like a seqcount, however this allows multiple
+  write-sides to hold it at once...". The read side critical section
+  is enclosed by ``mmu_interval_read_begin() /
+  mmu_interval_read_retry()`` with ``mmu_interval_read_begin()``
+  sleeping uninterruptibly if the write side is held.
+  The write side is held by the core mm while calling mmu interval
+  invalidation notifiers.
+* The ``gpu_vm->resv`` lock. Protects the gpu_vm's list of gpu_vmas needing
+  rebinding, and also the residency of all the gpu_vm's local GEM object.
+* The ``gpu_vm->userptr_notifier_lock``. This is an rwsem that is taken in read
+  mode during exec and write mode during a mmu notifier invalidation. In
+  the absence of a separate page-table lock, this lock can serve
+  together with the gpu_vm's dma_resv lock as a page-table lock. More on
+  this below. The userptr notifier lock is per gpu_vm.
+* The ``gpu_vm->page_table_lock``. Protects the gpu_vm's page-table updates. For
+  simplicity the gpu_vm's dma_resv lock can be reused as page-table lock.
+
+There are certain optimizations described below that require
+additional locks. More on that later.
+
+.. code-block:: C
+
+   dma_resv_lock(&gpu_vm->resv);
+
+   for_each_gpu_vma_on_revalidate_list(gpu_vm, &gpu_vma) {
+		revalidate_gpu_vma(&gpu_vma);
+		remove_from_revalidate_list(&gpu_vma);
+   }
+
+   add_dependencies(&gpu_job, &gpu_vm->resv);
+   job_dma_fence = gpu_submit(&gpu_job));
+
+   add_dma_fence(job_dma_fence, &gpu_vm->resv);
+   dma_resv_unlock(&gpu_vm->resv);
+
+Eviction of one of these local objects will then be something like the
+following:
+
+.. code-block:: C
+
+   obj = get_object_from_lru();
+
+   dma_resv_lock(obj->resv);
+   for_each_gpu_vma_of_obj(obj, &gpu_vma);
+		put_gpu_vma_on_revalidate_list(&gpu_vma);
+
+   add_dependencies(&eviction_job, &obj->resv);
+   job_dma_fence = gpu_submit(&eviction_job);
+   add_dma_fence(&obj->resv, job_dma_fence);
+
+   dma_resv_unlock(&obj->resv);
+   put_object(obj);
+
+Note that since the object is local to the gpu_vm, it will share the gpu_vm's
+``dma_resv`` lock so that ``obj->resv == gpu_vm->resv``. Invalidated gpu_vmas are put
+on the gpu_vm's revalidation list, which is protected by ``gpu_vm->resv``, which
+is always locked while evicting, due to the above equality.
+
+For VM_BIND gpu_vms, gpu_vmas don't need to be unbound before eviction,
+Since the eviction blit or copy will wait for GPU idle, any attempt by
+the GPU to access freed memory through the gpu_vma will be preceded by
+a new exec function, which will make sure the gpu_vma is
+revalidated. The eviction code holding the object's dma_resv while
+revalidating will ensure a new exec function may not race with the eviction.
+
+Introducing external (or shared) buffer objects
+===============================================
+
+Since shared buffer objects may be shared by multiple gpu_vm's they
+can't share their reservation object with a single gpu_vm, but will rather
+have a reservation object of their own. The shared objects bound to a
+gpu_vm using one or many
+gpu_vmas are therefore typically put on a per-gpu_vm list which is
+protected by the gpu_vm lock. One could in theory protect it also with
+the ``gpu_vm->resv``, but since the list of dma_resvs to take is typically
+built before the ``gpu_vm->resv`` is locked due to a limitation in
+the current locking helpers, that is typically not done. Also see
+below for userptr gpu_vmas.
+
+At eviction time we now need to invalidate *all* gpu_vmas of a shared
+object, but we can no longer be certain that we hold the gpu_vm's
+dma_resv of all the object's gpu_vmas. We can only be certain that we
+hold the object's private dma_resv. We can trylock the dma_resvs for
+the affected gpu_vm's but that might be unnecessarily complex. If we
+have a ww_acquire context at hand at eviction time we can also perform
+sleeping locks of those dma_resvs but that could cause expensive
+rollbacks. One option is to just mark the invalidated gpu_vmas with a bool
+which is inspected on the next exec function, when the gpu_vm's
+dma_resv and the object's dma_resv is held, and the invalidated
+gpu_vmas could then be put on the gpu_vm's list of invalidated
+gpu_vmas. That bool would then, although being per-gpu_vma formally be
+protected by the object's dma_resv.
+
+The exec function would then look something like the following:
+
+.. code-block:: C
+
+   read_lock(&gpu_vm->lock);
+
+   dma_resv_lock(&gpu_vm->resv);
+
+   // Shared object list is protected by the gpu_vm->lock.
+   for_each_shared_obj(gpu_vm, &obj) {
+		dma_resv_lock(&obj->resv);
+		move_marked_gpu_vmas_to_revalidate_gpu_vma_list(obj, &gpu_vm);
+   }
+
+   for_each_gpu_vma_to_revalidate(gpu_vm, &gpu_vma) {
+		revalidate_gpu_vma(&gpu_vma);
+		remove_from_revalidate_list(&gpu_vma);
+   }
+
+   add_dependencies(&gpu_job, &gpu_vm->resv);
+   job_dma_fence = gpu_submit(&gpu_job));
+
+   add_dma_fence(job_dma_fence, &gpu_vm->resv);
+   for_each_shared_obj(gpu_vm, &obj)
+          add_dma_fence(job_dma_fence, &obj->resv);
+   dma_resv_unlock_all_resv_locks();
+
+   read_unlock(&gpu_vm->lock);
+
+And the corresponding shared-object aware eviction would look like:
+
+.. code-block:: C
+
+   obj = get_object_from_lru();
+
+   dma_resv_lock(obj->resv);
+   for_each_gpu_vma_of_obj(obj, &gpu_vma);
+		if (object_is_vm_local(obj))
+		             put_gpu_vma_on_revalidate_list(&gpu_vma, &gpu_vm);
+		else
+		             mark_gpu_vma_for_revalidation(&gpu_vma);
+
+   add_dependencies(&eviction_job, &obj->resv);
+   job_dma_fence = gpu_submit(&eviction_job);
+   add_dma_fence(&obj->resv, job_dma_fence);
+
+   dma_resv_unlock(&obj->resv);
+   put_object(obj);
+
+Yet another option is to put the gpu_vmas to be invalidated on a separate
+gpu_vm list protected by a lower level lock that can be taken both at eviction
+time and at transfer-to-revalidate list time. The details are not in
+this document, but this for reference implemented in the Intel xe
+driver.
+
+Introducing userptr gpu_vmas
+============================
+
+A userptr gpu_vma is a gpu_vma that, instead of mapping a buffer object to a
+GPU virtual address range, directly maps a CPU mm range of anonymous-
+or file page-cache pages.
+A very simple approach would be to just pin the pages using
+pin_user_pages() at bind time and unpin them at unbind time, but this
+creates a Denial-Of-Service vector since a single user-space process
+would be able to pin down all of system memory, which is not
+desirable. (For special use-cases and with proper accounting pinning might
+still be a desirable feature, though). What we need to do in the general case is
+to obtain a reference to the desired pages, make sure we are notified
+using a MMU notifier just before the CPU mm unmaps the pages, dirty
+them if they are not mapped read-only to the GPU, and then drop the reference.
+When we are notified by the MMU notifier that CPU mm is about to drop the
+pages, we need to stop GPU access to the pages,
+GPU page-table and make sure that before the next time the GPU tries to access
+whatever is now present in the CPU mm range, we unmap the old pages
+from the GPU page tables and repeat the process of obtaining new page
+references. Note that when the core mm decides to laundry pages, we get such
+an unmap MMU notification and can mark the pages dirty again before the
+next GPU access. We also get similar MMU notifications for NUMA accounting
+which the GPU driver doesn't really need to care about, but so far
+it's proven difficult to exclude certain notifications.
+
+Using a MMU notifier for device DMA (and other methods) is described in
+`this document
+<https://docs.kernel.org/core-api/pin_user_pages.html#case-3-mmu-notifier-registration-with-or-without-page-faulting-hardware>`_.
+
+Now the method of obtaining struct page references using
+get_user_pages() unfortunately can't be used under a dma_resv lock
+since that would violate the locking order of the dma_resv lock vs the
+mmap_lock that is grabbed when resolving a CPU pagefault. This means the gpu_vm's
+list of userptr gpu_vmas needs to be protected by an outer lock, and this
+is the first time we strictly need the gpu_vm->lock. While it was
+previously used also to protect the list of the gpu_vm's shared objects,
+we could in theory have used the gpu_vm->resv for that.
+
+The MMU interval seqlock for a userptr gpu_vma is used in the following
+way:
+
+.. code-block:: C
+
+   down_read(&gpu_vm->lock);
+
+   retry:
+
+   // Note: mmu_interval_read_begin() blocks until there is no
+   // invalidation notifier running anymore.
+   seq = mmu_interval_read_begin(&gpu_vma->userptr_interval);
+   if (seq != gpu_vma->saved_seq) {
+           obtain_new_page_pointers(&gpu_vma);
+	   dma_resv_lock(&gpu_vm->resv);
+	   put_gpu_vma_on_revalidate_list(&gpu_vma, &gpu_vm);
+	   dma_resv_unlock(&gpu_vm->resv);
+	   gpu_vma->saved_seq = seq;
+   }
+
+   // The usual revalidation goes here.
+
+   // Final userptr sequence validation may not happen before the
+   // submission dma_fence is added to the gpu_vm's resv, from the POW
+   // of the MMU invalidation notifier. Hence the
+   // userptr_notifier_lock that will make them appear atomic.
+
+   add_dependencies(&gpu_job, &gpu_vm->resv);
+   down_read(&gpu_vm->userptr_notifier_lock);
+   if (mmu_interval_read_retry(&gpu_vma->userptr_interval, gpu_vma->saved_seq)) {
+          up_read(&gpu_vm->userptr_notifier_lock);
+	  goto retry;
+   }
+
+   job_dma_fence = gpu_submit(&gpu_job));
+
+   add_dma_fence(job_dma_fence, &gpu_vm->resv);
+
+   for_each_shared_obj(gpu_vm, &obj)
+          add_dma_fence(job_dma_fence, &obj->resv);
+
+   dma_resv_unlock_all_resv_locks();
+   up_read(&gpu_vm->userptr_notifier_lock);
+   up_read(&gpu_vm->lock);
+
+The code between ``mmu_interval_read_begin()`` and the
+``mmu_interval_read_retry()`` marks the read side critical section of
+what we call the ``userptr_seqlock``. In reality the gpu_vm's userptr
+gpu_vma list is looped through, and the check is done for *all* of its
+userptr gpu_vmas, although we only show a single one here.
+
+The userptr gpu_vma MMU invalidation notifier might be called from
+reclaim context and, again to avoid locking order violations, we can't
+take any dma_resv lock nor the gpu_vm->lock from within it.
+
+.. code-block:: C
+
+  bool gpu_vma_userptr_invalidate(userptr_interval, cur_seq)
+  {
+          // Make sure the exec function either sees the new sequence
+	  // and backs off or we wait for the dma-fence:
+
+          down_write(&gpu_vm->userptr_notifier_lock);
+	  mmu_interval_set_seq(userptr_interval, cur_seq);
+	  up_write(&gpu_vm->userptr_notifier_lock);
+
+	  dma_resv_wait_timeout(&gpu_vm->resv, DMA_RESV_USAGE_BOOKKEEP,
+		                false, MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT);
+	  return true;
+  }
+
+When this invalidation notifier returns, the GPU can no longer be
+accessing the old pages of the userptr gpu_vma and needs to redo the page-binding
+before a new GPU submission can succeed.
+
+Optimizing gpu_vma iteration
+----------------------------
+
+Iterating through all of a gpu_vm's userptr gpu_vmas to check the validity
+on each exec function may be very costly. There is a scheme to avoid
+this and only iterate through the userptr gpu_vmas that actually saw an
+invalidation notifier call since the last exec. T
+
+TODO: describe that scheme here. It's implemented in the xe driver.
