--- Comment #7 from Ilia Mirkin (imirkin@alum.mit.edu) ---
[ 2460.923220] nouveau 0000:08:00.0: can't change power state from D3hot to D0
(config space inaccessible)

That's just really bad. My guess is that the "big-endian" notice is just due to
a register returning all 0xffffffff (we try to flip the GPU into little-endian
mode if we can). Seems like there are issues with the TB enclosure, or
something along those lines.

It does seem like you got further earlier to have gotten the "unknown chipset"
error, but by the time you were running lspci above, they were gone already
(returning all 1's, and PCI is active-low, so that just means it's all off).
Don't know what the difference is, I know nothing about those enclosures. I'd
try to disable any sort of power management that might be turning the enclosure
off.
