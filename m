But essentially the right thing to do. The only alternative I can see is 
to reverse the role of exporter and importer.

Well why not? Those devices are coherent in the sense of the DMA API 
that they don't need an extra CPU copy on sync_to_cpu/sync_to_device.

We could come up with a better name for coherency, e.g. snooping for 
example. But that is just an documentation detail.

And this the exact wrong approach as far as I can see. As Daniel noted 
as well we absolutely need some kind of coherency between exporter and 
importer.

This can either be provided by the PCI specification which makes it 
mandatory for device to snoop the caches or by platform devices agreeing 
that they only work on uncached memory.

Explicit cache flush operations are simple not part of the design of 
DMA-buf because they are not part of the design of the higher level APIs 
like Vulkan and OpenGL.

Adding this to DMA-buf for the rather special use case would completely 
break that and make live much more complicated for everybody.

What you mean is CXL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compute_Express_Link

And yes we support that in a bunch of configurations and also have 
worked with that and amdgpu with DMA-buf based shared.

This should not be a problem with this approach.

Well, not really. As I said I see what you have in mind here as 
completely wrong approach we will certainly not support in any GPU driver.

What we can do is to request the use case which won't work and this is 
exactly what the patch here does.

Christian.
