--- Comment #5 from Richard Thier <u9vata@gmail.com> ---
Hi!

Was it looking similar? Was it solved for your case?

Btw I just started to have insights on what the hardware does, but might ne=
ed
to work a bit in the wine field because of the good weather so if I am off a
bit for a day or two it will not mean I am stuck with the problem.

I think I will add extra logs soon to have a grasp about what is going on.
