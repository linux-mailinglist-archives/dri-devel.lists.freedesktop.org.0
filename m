--- Comment #28 from Lyude Paul (lyude@redhat.com) ---

Hi-so, my first guess then might actually be a bad DP adapter. In my experience
DP cables (usually the full-size ones, but I've had it happen with one or two
passive adapters as well) have a bad habit of breaking really easily. One time
I actually spent a week trying to fix a bug that'd I'd already tried
troubleshooting by replacing the DP cable, only to eventually find out the
cable I replaced it with also magically went bad.

Mind posting one more log with the same parameters as last time? I probably
can't tell for sure but usually you'll see a lot of link training failures or
timeouts when the cable has gone bad (but sometimes the symptoms are a lot more
sinister...). As well, I'd also try another adapter of course.
