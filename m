--- Comment #51 from Alexander Jones (acjones8@hawaii.edu) ---
For what it's worth, I believe I might be suffering from this bug. I have a
ThinkPad A275, with an AMD A12 9800B CPU and an R7 integrated GPU, and I can
reliably produce a crash on suspend every single time. It produces an image
like this when it wakes up: https://imgur.com/tKAxlI7

As you can see, a complete garbled mess. X11 becomes completely unresponsive; I
can't quit it, switch to a VT, or do anything whatsoever, only a hard reset
fixes it. The screen glitchiness does seem to flicker and slightly change while
mashing buttons though. Other aspects of the computer work fine though; the CPU
fan maintains the same speed, the power LED blinks normally, the dot on the i
on the back of the lid pulses like normal, and I can still change the
keyboard's backlight with no problems. 

I'm running OpenSUSE Tumbleweed at the moment. With kernel 5.2.X, I never had
any crashes whatsoever, but once Tumbleweed updated to 5.3 or 5.4, it will fail
every single time to resume. I'm currently running 5.5.4.1 and the issue is
still here. I don't have any kernel hacking or debugging experience, but I'm
willing to upload any logs that might prove helpful, if you can tell me which
ones those might be.
