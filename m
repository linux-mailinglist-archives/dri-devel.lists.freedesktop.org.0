I think the most obvious case would be accounting the size of tiler heap chunks. These
are created as a response to OOM events when the device's tiling engine runs out of
scratch space. Even though tiler heap growth events are kicked by the scheduler, they
are bound to the DRM context for which the heap had first been created. We would like
to keep a separate count of the size of these objects, together with the ones I described
in the commit messages and before on this thread.

In the case of Panthor, we definitely do, or at least that's the consensus we had
struck at Collabora. However, if there's no interest in having this generalised onto
other drivers, then perhaps the best way forward would be keeping this drm fdinfo
key private for Panthor, and maybe discuss whether it would make sense to expand it
to the DRM fdinfo core in the future.
