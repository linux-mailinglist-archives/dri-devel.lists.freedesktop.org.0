I means that it destroy the my drm driver's framework.
I means that we are all-in-one driver. The solution you
mentioned have side effect also. That is because user-space
will open the PCI device first, not your created virtual platform device.

I means that the idea(solution) you told me is still a workaround.
bring no benifits to the drm driver itself.

I have said that PCI KMS display drivers is different,Â  because of user 
space open the PCI device.

I don't need to either, I want to maintain this by myself.

Copy and modify.

Well I don't think my patch actually reduce something.
Please see i915, amdgpu, radeon and nouveau.
Non of them use the DRM bridge drivers.
It is just that the various DRM bridge drivers are not suitable to use for my driver.
