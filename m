Yes that is my plan, but see my last reply to Benjamin, it might not be trivial 
as different leds in the same LampArray might have different max values for red, 
green, blue, and intensity. And the LampArray spec even allows to mix RGB and 
non-RGB leds.

There was something in the last discussion why this might not work, but i can't 
put my finger on it.

Sadly not easily, we get the BIOS from the ODMs and don't have the source and 
built tools for it so we need to request each change individually from the ODMs.

TBH I don't know where to look for an example myself, on how the appropriate

Only if it is ansii or iso layout. The id's for the special keys and the key 
positions are not provided by the firmware.
