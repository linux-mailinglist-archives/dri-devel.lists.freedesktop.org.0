This loop is already bound by a timer and if no forward progress is made
we pop out of this loop. It is assumed if this happens the GuC / GPU is
dead a and full GPU reset will have to be issued. A following patch
adds the timer, a bit later in submission section of the series a patch
is added to trigger the reset.
