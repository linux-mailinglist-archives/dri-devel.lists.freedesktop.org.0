Not at all, it is complicated and open whether it is worth improving.

I don't think it is a grub bug. To me it seems like an unfortunate 
consequence of protocol limitations.

I am not a grub expert, but I had a brief look at its codebase, and 
AFAICT it draws by software rendering into a shadow frame buffer and 
calls GOP->Blit to update the screen.

As such my assumption is that with the fake 1280x800 mode, firmware 
implements the blit to rotate under the hood.

So for grub everything is fine. It sets 1280x800, sees 1280x800, renders 
the menu in there, and courtesy of firmware blit the menu is presented 
in the human friendly orientation.

Note this is all when grub is asked to change the mode to 1280x800. This 
does not happen on the normal SteamOS boot, but only if grub menu was 
entered. Otherwise mode stays at the default 800x1280 and the DRM quirk 
triggers to set the orientation both for the simple DRM fb, efidrmfb and 
later the real amdgpu drm fd.

In other words without this patch fbcon is correctly rotated when the 
mode is default 800x1280, but broken if grub menu is entered which sets 
the mode to 1280x800. Because the DRM panel orientation quirk only 
triggers for 800x1280.

Hence this patch/quirk to fudge the screen info back into the native 
mode and allow the orientation quirk to always work and fbcon always be 
right.

Questionable part is that it only fixes the user experience for people 
who enter the boot menu, so probably only developers. And the broken 
fbcon is only until amdgpu takes it over, which correctly probes the 
mode, I guess from the display state, and always sees it as 800x1280 and 
so panel orientation quirk matches.

I suppose for DRM panic before amdgpu loads, or before it fully 
initializes, it would be worth having an readable fbcon, but again, I 
accept it is probably a border line case so if people do not want to 
take this quirk then it is what it is.
