Subject: drm/vmwgfx: Fix crtc's atomic check conditional

From: Zack Rusin <zack.rusin@broadcom.com>

commit a60ccade88f926e871a57176e86a34bbf0db0098 upstream.

The conditional was supposed to prevent enabling of a crtc state
without a set primary plane. Accidently it also prevented disabling
crtc state with a set primary plane. Neither is correct.

Fix the conditional and just driver-warn when a crtc state has been
enabled without a primary plane which will help debug broken userspace.

Fixes IGT's kms_atomic_interruptible and kms_atomic_transition tests.
