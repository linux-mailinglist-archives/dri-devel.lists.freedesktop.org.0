Imo it boils down to "past mistakes don't justify continued screw-ups" or
so :-) As in, we really should make sure we make them unique if they
differ between platforms.

I think the only ok exception is if the compression uses some special
memory/buffer and hence the buffer simply cannot be exported to another
device. Or at least not any device which doesn't have access to that
special memory (and hence by necessity of being part of the same SoC or
interconnect probably knows what's going on anyway).

Another one is r/ed drivers, especially when baked into a given soc, were
it's just a bit too hard to fully figure out the layout everywhere (and
also kinda a waste of time).

But yeah it would be good to document in drm_fourcc.h that a) we screwed
up in the past and b) we shouldn't, at least not for anything that can be
used in discrete gpus.
