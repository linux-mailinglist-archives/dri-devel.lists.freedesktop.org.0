Yes. HID-BPF allows to customize a HID device by changing the report
descriptor and/or the events, and the requests made from hidraw.

It's a HID -> HID conversion, but controlled by userspace.

See [0] for a tutorial.

You'll need a thin WMI to HID wrapper, but without LampArray.
Then you load the HID-BPF program from userspace, that program knows
about the specifics of the device, and can do the LampArray transform.

Which means that once the wmi-to-hid driver specific to this device is
built in the kernel, you can adjust your LampArray implementation (the
device specifics micrometers and what not) from usersapce.

Except that your current implementation also does the LampArray
conversion. I think it'll make more sense to provide an almost raw
access to the underlying protocol (think of it like your own Tuxedo
vendor collection in HID), and handle the LampArray weirdeness in bpf:
definition of the device physicals, conversion from HID LampArray
commands into Tuxedo specifics.

That's what makes more sense to me at least. Other operating systems
export the HID nodes directly, so userspace prefers to talk to the
device directly. So I'd rather rely on a standard than trying to fit the
current use case in a new interface that will probably fail.

That could be done in HID-core as well. Making it part of HID-core also
means that once we get an actual LampArray device, we'll get support for
it from day one.

Please have a look at the tutorial[0]. That tutorial is missing the
couple of new hooks you'll need to change the requests emitted from
hidraw as LampArray into Tuxedo, but I can also give you a help into
making it happening.

Basically, you also need to define a .hid_hw_request callback in your
HID_BPF_OPS and extract all of the code you have here into that bpf
program (which is roughly C code).

Cheers,
Benjamin
