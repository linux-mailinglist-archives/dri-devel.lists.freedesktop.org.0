Sorry, probably i did not understand your proposal clearly.

1) move both data-lanes and link-frequencies property from dp controller 
endpoint to phy

2) phy_configure() return succeed if both data-lanes and link 
frequencies are supported. otherwise return failed.

is above two summary items correct?

Currently phy_configure()Â  is part of link training process and called 
if link lanes or rate changes.

however, since current phy_configure() implementation always return 0, 
the return value is not checking.

This proposal is new, can we discuss more detail at meeting and decide 
to implement it or not.

Meanwhile can we merge current implementation (both data-lanes and 
link-frequqncies at dp controller end point) first?
