Initially ExynosDSI was written with panel support only, in such case 
developer can explicitly control time of calling panel ops - and that 
was good.

Later, adding bridge support showed that bridge chain has fixed call 
order which is incompatible with Exynos, so the driver needs to calls 
bridge ops explicitly - flexibility was scarified for simplicity.

For me, fixed order of calls in the whole chain 
(crtc->encoder->bridges...->panel) seems incorrect. Crtc starts 
transmission but the encoder is not yet ready, the same with encoder and 
bridges, later is slightly better - bridges have two ops (pre_enable, 
enable) but since they are not well defined developers are confused what 
should be performed where, as a result we have incompatible approaches.

Only panels have well defined opses: .prepare is for getting panel ready 
for video transmission, .enable is called after starting transmission to 
start showing the image (backlight-on or MIPI_DCS_SET_DISPLAY_ON).

Apparently this model somehow works, probably due to nice hardware and 
custom hacks, but as we see more complicated protocols like DSI or more 
delicate devices cannot be handled with such callbacks.

In case of Exynos DSI and s6e8aa0 panel we need to implement complicated 
sequence, which I have implemented this way:

1. Power on DSI host, start clocks, enable DSI PHY: 
pm_runtime_resume_and_get->exynos_dsi_resume.

2. Power on DSI device: 
drm_panel_prepare->s6e8aa0_prepare->s6e8aa0_power_on.

3. Initialize DSI host: 
drm_panel_prepare->s6e8aa0_prepare->s6e8aa0_set_sequence->...mipi_dsi_device_transfer->...->exynos_dsi_init.

4. Initialize DSI device: 
drm_panel_prepare->s6e8aa0_prepare->s6e8aa0_set_sequence (bulk of MIPI 
DCS/MCS commands).

5. Configure and start video stream on host: 
exynos_dsi_set_display_mode, exynos_dsi_set_display_enable.

6. Show the image: drm_panel_enable


I guess LP-11 state is after DSI host init (3).

If you put such calls into dsi host it will work, this is minus of the 
flexibility - you must do on your own.

The latter is rather blocking issue, maybe you can overcome it by adding 
mipi_host callbacks: power_on, init - this way you can call them from 
device's pre_enable

This would solve the issues described later.

It seems little bit hacky, but quite easy to implement, what do you think.

Nodoby tried to implement it yet, if you want patches are welcome.
