Yes I agree. I was only thinking about adding some DRM device discovery 
code in a more decoupled fashion from the current plugin, for both the 
reason discussed above (decoupling a bit from reliance on kfd sysfs), 
and then also if/when a new DRM driver might want to implement this the 
code could be move to some common plugin area.

I am not sure how feasible that would be though. The "gpu id" concept 
and it's matching in the current kernel code and CRIU plugin - is that 
value tied to the physical GPU instance or how it works?

Got it.
