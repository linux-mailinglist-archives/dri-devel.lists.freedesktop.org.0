No problem, I had this info already and the 1280x800 mode has the same 
pixel format as all the rest - PIXEL_BGR_RESERVED_8BIT_PER_COLOR.

If it was set to PIXEL_BLT_ONLY, there would be no screen info set up, 
right? So neither simpledrmfb or efidrmfb, or even legacy efifb, would 
probe ie. there would be no fbcon until amdgpu loads?
