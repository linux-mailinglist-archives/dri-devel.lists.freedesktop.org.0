Right, is that wired up on msm? And if it is, or could be, how do/would 
you map the three priority levels for GPUs which expose 3 priority 
levels versus the one which exposes 12?

Is it doable properly without leaking the fact drm/sched internal 
implementation detail of three priority levels? Or if you went the other 
way and only exposed up to max 3 levels, then you lose one priority 
level your hardware suppose which is also not good.

It is all quite interesting because your hardware is completely 
different from ours in this respect. In our case i915 decides when to 
preempt, hardware has no concept of priority (*).

Regards,

Tvrtko

(*) Almost no concept of priority in hardware - we do have it on new 
GPUs and only on a subset of engine classes where render and compute 
share the EUs. But I think it's way different from Ardenos.
