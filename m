Before this commit a suspend + resume of the LPSS PWM controller
would result in the controller being reset to its defaults of
output-freq = clock/256, duty-cycle=100%, until someone changes
to the output-freq and/or duty-cycle are made.

This problem has been masked so far because the main consumer
(the i915 driver) was always making duty-cycle changes on resume.
With the conversion of the i915 driver to the atomic PWM API the
driver now only disables/enables the PWM on suspend/resume leaving
the output-freq and duty as is, triggering this problem.

The LPSS PWM controller has a mechanism where the ctrl register value
and the actual base-unit and on-time-div values used are latched. When
software sets the SW_UPDATE bit then at the end of the current PWM cycle,
the new values from the ctrl-register will be latched into the actual
registers, and the SW_UPDATE bit will be cleared.

The problem is that before this commit our suspend/resume handling
consisted of simply saving the PWM ctrl register on suspend and
restoring it on resume, without setting the PWM_SW_UPDATE bit.
When the controller has lost its state over a suspend/resume and thus
has been reset to the defaults, just restoring the register is not
enough. We must also set the SW_UPDATE bit to tell the controller to
latch the restored values into the actual registers.

Fixing this problem is not as simple as just or-ing in the value which
is being restored with SW_UPDATE. If the PWM was enabled before we must
write the new settings + PWM_SW_UPDATE before setting PWM_ENABLE.
We must also wait for PWM_SW_UPDATE to become 0 again and depending on the
model we must do this either before or after the setting of PWM_ENABLE.

All the necessary logic for doing this is already present inside
pwm_lpss_apply(), so instead of duplicating this inside the resume
handler, this commit makes the resume handler use pwm_lpss_apply() to
restore the settings when necessary. This fixes the output-freq and
duty-cycle being reset to their defaults on resume.

Changes in v3:
- This replaces the "pwm: lpss: Set SW_UPDATE bit when enabling the PWM"
  patch from previous versions of this patch-set, which really was a hack
  working around the resume issue which this patch fixes properly.
