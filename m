--- Comment #24 from tempel.julian@gmail.com ---
I've mentioned kwin-lowlatency in this ticket:
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3D108917#add_comment

It can be used as some kind of workaround for this wine issue, as the stutt=
er
doesn't occur when kwin compositing (and thus vsync) is enabled on top of t=
he
games' vsync.

Of course this is far from being optimal, as
1. It breaks FreeSync.
2. There is an additional backbuffer queue, causing additional input (or
perhaps better output) latency.
3. It may introduce additional stutter when framerate drops below refreshra=
te

---

FreeSync situation for wine games seems really terrible with due to this bu=
g.
