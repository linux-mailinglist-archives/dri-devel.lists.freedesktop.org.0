So you think a one line patch should take one minute to produce ... I
really don't think that's grounded in reality.  I suppose a one line
patch only takes a minute to merge with b4 if no-one reviews or tests
it, but that's not really desirable.

I'm framing the discussion in terms of the whole series of changes we
have done for fall through, both what's in the tree currently (889
patches) both in terms of the produce and the consumer.  That's what I
used for my figures for cost.

Part of what I'm trying to measure is the "and useful" bit because
that's not a given.

so the proverb "straw which broke the camel's back" uniquely doesn't
apply to maintainers

That's another potential reason, but it doesn't may other reasons less
valid.

Well, you know, subsystems are very different in terms of the amount of
patches a maintainer has to process per release cycle of the kernel. 
If a maintainer is close to capacity, additional patches, however
trivial, become a problem.  If a maintainer has spare cycles, trivial
patches may look easy.

No, I evaluated the producer side in terms of an FTE.  What we're
mostly arguing about here is the consumer side: the maintainers and
people who have to rework their patch sets. I estimated that at 100h.

You seem to be saying that because you find it easy to merge trivial
patches, everyone should.  I'm reminded of a friend long ago who
thought being a Tees River Pilot was a sinecure because he could
navigate the Tees blindfold.  What he forgot, of course, is that just
because it's easy with a trawler doesn't mean it's easy with an oil
tanker.  In fact it takes longer to qualify as a Tees River Pilot than
it does to get a PhD.
