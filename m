So - ModeObject itself of course defines the methods that should be availab=
le
on any mode object, the ability to get a raw pointer to the drm_mode_object
struct - and a reference to the DRM Device. I assume you might understand
struct mode_config already on the C side of things, e.g. we have mode objec=
ts
like drm_connector, drm_framebuffer, etc. - they have various object IDs.
Additionally, some mode objects are refcounted (drm_connector and
drm_framebuffer are two examples), while others aren't (drm_crtc, drm_plane=
).

Now, object lifetimes in Rust and C are pretty different. You need to have
well defined lifetimes for everything in both languages, but C leaves this =
as
an exercise for the programmer with little to no formal verification. Rust =
on
the other hand is very explicit about this, and requires that you ensure in
some way that the compiler is able to verify these lifetimes. Even for
resources that might live for as long as the driver itself does, we still n=
eed
to be able to ensure this is /always/ the case and prove it to the compiler=
.
For short function scopes where we're passed a reference (&'a Device) to th=
e
device, we can just pass a reference to the mode object using a lifetime th=
at
lives as long as the device reference 'a, or define a new lifetime that is =
a
separate borrow but lives just as long ('b: 'a). For long living structures
that leave the scope of a &'a Device though, it's impossible for us to defi=
ne
a lifetime to express this.

In rvkms we do actually have an example of this, where we use an hrtimer to
emulate a vblank interrupt. Since we need access to the respective CRTC for
the vblank interrupt, the structure we embed our hrtimer in either be the C=
rtc
itself (I'll explain a little below why we can, but don't really want to do
this in rust), or to be able to somehow ensure that Crtc can't be destroyed
for as long as the hrtimer containing vblank timer struct lives.

So, in rust when you face situations like this: generally the solution is t=
o
do something that ensures the object in question lives for as long as
necessary. The easiest form of this of course is refcounting, which we can
easily fallback to for mode objects that have a refcount (hence RcModeObjec=
t).
For RcModeObject, this super-trait is mainly just there to make implementin=
g
the kernel's types for objects with embedded refcounts (AlwaysRefCounted)
easy; since every reference counted mode object uses the exact same functio=
ns
for ref/unref. So instead of making every ref-counted mode object implement
AlwaysRefCounted, we just introduce RcModeObject - and then have
AlwaysRefCounted automatically implemented using drm_mode_object_get()/put(=
)
and ModeObject for any given type T that implements RcModeObject.

Note that we can't do this solely through ModeObject, simply because there'=
s
no way to say "Implement AlwaysRefCounted for T, but only if T implements s=
ome
specific refcounting method". Trait methods can be optional, but we can't
really check if they're specified or not through just a trait bound. So
instead we make it an unsafe super-trait of ModeObject. This is also called
the "new type pattern", and is very heavily used in a lot of rust code.

But how do we actively ensure a mode object without a refcount stays alive?
What about drm_crtc, we need it for the vblank timer? The answer of course =
is
that we can't, BUT! We already established a static mode object is valid fo=
r
as long as it's respective Device is active. Which subsequently implies tha=
t
if can take a refcount for the Device, the static mode object will remain
alive for as long as that refcount is held. This is the main purpose of
StaticModeObject and KmsRef. StaticModeObject just indicates a ModeObject w=
ith
no refcount, and KmsRef can contain any StaticModeObject. And KmsRef will k=
eep
the mode object alive by using ModeObject's trait methods to acquire a owne=
d
refcount to the parent device for as long as the KmsRef lives.

Rememeber too: this needs to use the new type pattern as well, there's no w=
ay
for us to create a trait bound that relies on not implementing a trait
(!Send/!Sync are exceptions to this, but that's out of scope for this
explanation).

Nope - none of them would, but we should be ensuring that the DRM device is
alive (and at least allocated) for as long as any owned reference (static o=
r
rc) to a mode object. Though=E2=80=A6

You did just make me have the sad realization that a reference counted mode
object does not in fact, ensure that it's parent device stays alive with
drm_device_get(). I guess that's probably something worth me sending a patc=
h
for D:!.
