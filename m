Well, I have just grepped across the drm-tip kernel branch, but I don't find
iMX LCDIF you mentioned. See the search results pasted at bellow.


$ find . -name "*.dts" -type f | xargs grep "lontium,lt9611uxc"
./arm64/boot/dts/qcom/sm8450-hdk.dts:		compatible = "lontium,lt9611uxc";
./arm64/boot/dts/qcom/qrb5165-rb5.dts:		compatible = "lontium,lt9611uxc";
./arm64/boot/dts/qcom/qrb2210-rb1.dts:		compatible = "lontium,lt9611uxc";
./arm64/boot/dts/qcom/qrb4210-rb2.dts:		compatible = "lontium,lt9611uxc";
./arm64/boot/dts/qcom/sm8350-hdk.dts:		compatible = "lontium,lt9611uxc";


So I can't see the drm driver that you refer to, can you pointed it out for study
purpose? Even it's exist, however, back to that time, why don't you posting a patch
to switch it to the canonical design as you mentioned and give the community a clean
design?
  
And those are just *reasons*, from the viewpoint of the *result*.
The merged patch results in a 'side-by-side' implement and boilerplate added
into drm bridges subsystem, the results doesn't change no matter what the
reason is, right?
