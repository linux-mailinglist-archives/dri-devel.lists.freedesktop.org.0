Please stop statements like this, it is not helpful and is doing nothing
but ensure that your patches will not be looked at in the future.

There is no requirement that anyone accept patches that are sent to
them.  When you complain when receiving comments on them, that
shows you do not wish to work with others.

Sorry, but you are now on my local blacklist for a while, and I
encourage other maintainers to just ignore these patches as well.
