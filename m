The PCI region-request functions become managed functions when
pcim_enable_device() has been called previously instead of
pci_enable_device().

This has already caused bugs by confusing users, who came to believe
that all pci functions, such as pci_iomap_range(), suddenly are managed
that way.

This is not the case.

Add comments to the relevant functions' docstrings that warn users about
this behavior.
