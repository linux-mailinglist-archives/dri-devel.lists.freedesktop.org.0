I'm not sure quite what scale of "tweaks" you are expecting. Obviously
adding new uAPI is possible at any time - the only requirement is "don't
break user space" - i.e. don't remove old uAPI. Although obviously you
want to be careful about adding it because that means supporting it
forever more.

Panfrost has had an "unstable_ioctls" module parameter that we've hidden
performance counters behind. (Performance counters are hard from a uAPI
perspective - Panthor has similar issues).

We've also added support for GPUs in a deliberately "crippled" manner
(e.g. only one core group - see panfrost_get_core_mask()). I think we're
mostly just hoping those 'awkward' GPUs are not interesting enough and
we'll never implement full support for them - but if we did I expect
we'd implement support by providing a new uAPI for enabling the second
core group so old user space can continue working with just the single
core group.

Of course if the support for this platform is actually 'broken' (the
talk of GPU resets makes me think so - on Mali requiring a reset is a
"should never happen" situation, but we do have errata...) then it's
probably best holding off merging this until you've got something which
is minimally functional and then add support as necessary. For Vulkan
you can always have user space require a particular DRM kernel version
if you discover extra uAPI is needed.
