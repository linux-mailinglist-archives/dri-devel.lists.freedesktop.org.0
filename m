Hello,

Thank you for the patches!

Isn't it a common behaviour for all DRM drivers to implicitly pin BO
while it's vmapped? I was sure it should be common /o\

Why would you want to kmap BO that isn't pinned?

Shouldn't TTM's vmap() be changed to do the pinning?

I missed that TTM doesn't pin BO on vmap() and now surprised to see it.
It should be a rather serious problem requiring backporting of the
fixes, but I don't see the fixes tags on the patches (?)
