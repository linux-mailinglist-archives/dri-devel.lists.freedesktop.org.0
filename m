I think the primary point of failure in the original calculation is due
to fact that the hs_prepare and hs_zero are defined in picoseconds (ps),
and the tx_byte_period is in nanoseconds (ns) as evident by the usage of
NSEC_PER_SEC macro.

The resulting tx_by_period is 1000 times smaller, and the reg_wakeup - a
1000 times larger. =)

Further, the TRM does indeed mention that some characterization is
required to fine tune the exact reg_wakeup value, but it ends up giving
a vague-ish formula -

-> reg_wakeup_time = wakeup_time_dsi + wakeup_time_cl + wakeup_time_dl +
		     (hs_host_eot Ã— 4 / lane_nb)

I think the characterization may only be required for the
wakeup_time_dsi component. The existing formula in the driver (after
corrected for time unit) is the wakeup_time_dl component. wakeup_time_cl
seems to be a range of constants, which the phy-core is auto-settling on
defaults. The document never specifically mentions "hs_host_eot" other
than the equation, but on the off-chance it is same as phy_cfg->eot,
then that's 0 and avoidable.
