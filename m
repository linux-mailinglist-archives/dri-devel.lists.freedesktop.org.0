I have ~ the same fps (even though it can go somewhat below in intense team
fights)

I have ~ the same for competitive maps.

For danger zone maps, namely big open maps, csgo 3d engine has disastrous
performance. Valve is aware of the problem. It seems there is a kind of cpu
cap somewhere since max or lowest 3d settings does not seem to impact
significantly the performance.

Don't forget: I heard southern island parts suffer from a critical mip mapping
bug/slowdown.

----

The real benchmark is how much time and how often the fps goes below 60 in the
worst realistic conditions (average does not matter).

---- 

I did re-install "rise of the tomb raider", I still get gpu vm faults.

If I recall properly "bioshock infinite" is gpu nasty even though it is a GL
game.
