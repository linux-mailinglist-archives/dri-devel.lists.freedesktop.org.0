I've looked over the panfrost code, and I can't see how this could
create a security hole there. It looks like there's a path which can
confuse the shrinker (so objects might not be purged when they could
be[1]) but they would be freed properly in the normal path - so no worse
than user space could already do.

[1] gpu_usecount is incremented in panfrost_lookup_bos() per bo, but not
decremented on failure.

This, however, looks plausible - and I can see how this could
potentially trigger a security hole in user space.

FWIW I think this makes the code easier to reason about, so
