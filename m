For now, we did not support reliable R/O long-term pinning in COW mappings.
That means, if we would trigger R/O long-term pinning in MAP_PRIVATE
mapping, we could end up pinning the (R/O-mapped) shared zeropage or a
pagecache page.

The next write access would trigger a write fault and replace the pinned
page by an exclusive anonymous page in the process page table; whatever the
process would write to that private page copy would not be visible by the
owner of the previous page pin: for example, RDMA could read stale data.
The end result is essentially an unexpected and hard-to-debug memory
corruption.

Some drivers tried working around that limitation by using
"FOLL_FORCE|FOLL_WRITE|FOLL_LONGTERM" for R/O long-term pinning for now.
FOLL_WRITE would trigger a write fault, if required, and break COW before
pinning the page. FOLL_FORCE is required because the VMA might lack write
permissions, and drivers wanted to make that working as well, just like
one would expect (no write access, but still triggering a write access to
break COW).

However, that is not a practical solution, because
(1) Drivers that don't stick to that undocumented and debatable pattern
    would still run into that issue. For example, VFIO only uses
    FOLL_LONGTERM for R/O long-term pinning.
(2) Using FOLL_WRITE just to work around a COW mapping + page pinning
    limitation is unintuitive. FOLL_WRITE would, for example, mark the
    page softdirty or trigger uffd-wp, even though, there actually isn't
    going to be any write access.
(3) The purpose of FOLL_FORCE is debug access, not access without lack of
    VMA permissions by arbitrarty drivers.

So instead, make R/O long-term pinning work as expected, by breaking COW
in a COW mapping early, such that we can remove any FOLL_FORCE usage from
drivers. More details in patch #8.

Patches #1--#3 add COW tests for non-anonymous pages.
Patches #4--#7 prepare core MM for extended FAULT_FLAG_UNSHARE support in
COW mappings.
Patch #8 implements reliable R/O long-term pinning in COW mappings
Patches #9--#19 remove any FOLL_FORCE usage from drivers.

I'm refraining from CCing all driver maintainers on the whole patch set.
