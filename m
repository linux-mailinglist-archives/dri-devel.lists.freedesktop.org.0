Yup, I think keeping the regular default device is a good idea.

Also I think initializing a new instance's vkms_config with the module
options we have would probably also make sense. Of course for new complex
features (like special plane features or attaching ebpf to implement
atomic_check restrictions) are best done only through configfs, so that we
can slowly deprecate the module options.

But for the handful of existing knobs I think it's fine to just keep it
all as-is.

Looking forward to your next round!
