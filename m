And exactly that is a really bad approach as far as I can see. The 
Vulkan stack on top simply doesn't know when to set this flag during CS.

That's also the reason the Valve guys came up with a solution where each 
BO gets a flag for explicit sync, but that only works for exports and 
not for imports.

Yes, I helped with that as well. But I think that this is just another 
workaround without really addressing the underlying problem.

I completely disagree.

In my opinion the implicit sync model we have for dma_resv currently is 
just not well designed at all, since it always requires cooperation from 
userspace.

In other words you need to know when to enable implicit sync in 
userspace and that information is simply not present all of the time.

What we have done here is just keeping the old reader/writer flags i915, 
radeon and nouveau once had and pushed that out to everybody else making 
the assumption that everybody would follow that without documenting the 
actual rules of engagement you need to follow here.

That was a really big mistake and we should try to fix that sooner or 
later. The only other clean alternative I see is to use a flag on the 
exporter to tell the importer if it should sync to shared fences or not.

Additional to that I'm perfectly fine with implicit sync. Explicit sync 
certainly has some use cases as well, but I don't see it as an absolute 
advantage over the implicit model.

Christian.
