The idea is that object drop order generally doesn't matter since things 
that care about other things should own them or hold references to them 
anyway, so the dependency graph of all the resources is encoded directly 
in the type hierarchy instead of having to open-code a "cleanup 
procedure"... which then invariably leads to corner cases when you have 
to do the same thing, or part of it, for error handling.

This has been working *very* well! It solves the issue of error handling 
since error handling just unwinds whatever was done to that point 
naturally in Rust (? operator), so there's practically no open-coded 
error handling code anywhere. The first time we ran into OOMs (Xonotic 
with no Mesa texture compression support yet, on 8GB machines on max 
settings...) the whole thing just worked. OOM killer went rampant and 
shmem doesn't account stuff to processes properly of course, but all the 
error paths, allocation errors, etc... all of that just worked, first 
try, across dozens of error paths that had never been tested before, not 
a single oops or deadlock or leak or anything in sight. Similarly, 
yesterday I did manage to run into drm_sched failing to create kthreads 
(the scaling issue Matthew's series fixes)... and still, that was fine. 
That happens on queue creation so it just bubbled up to Mesa as a failed 
ioctl and things kept moving along nicely otherwise. I even have nice 
ergonomic XArray semantics so that you can reserve a new slot, allocate 
some object, then populate it, and if you don't (because you errored out 
in between) it automatically gets freed again without explicit cleanup code.

And it also means that I can encode *firmware* resource dependencies in 
the type system (with Rust lifetimes attached to *GPU* pointers even - 
it's a bit dodgy how it's done but it works well in practice). Since it 
is absolutely critical that the firmware objects respect their lifetimes 
or else the whole thing crashes irrecoverably, this is the only way I 
feel it's been even practical to write this driver and not be a firmware 
crash mess. Of course we still get some crashes due to flaws in how I 
understand the firmware, but it's always things I don't know, not things 
I accidentally messed up in some corner case code path we don't normally 
hit, since I just don't have to think about that as long as the 
hierarchy is right.

I actually don't know exactly what precise order things get dropped in 
for this reason! I could find out, and it's predictable in Rust, what I 
mean is that thinking about a total order like that is not necessary for 
correctness as long as I got the ownership right. Off the top of my head 
though, it goes very roughly like this:

- On File close, all the GEM objects get closed (DRM core does this)
- This triggers explicit drops of all mappings in those GEM objects 
owned by that File (identified by unique ID, this is the one annoying 
circular reference thing I mentioned in the other thread...). At this 
point the GPU probably faults but we don't care. *
- The File itself gets dropped, which drops the XArrays for queues and 
(UAPI) VMs
   - UAPI VMs getting dropped doesn't do much other than unmap a single 
dummy object. The underlying MMU VM is refcounted and jobs hold 
references. This also drops the userspace VM object allocator used for 
kernel-managed allocations, but that too is internally refcounted and 
won't go away until all of its allocations do.
- Queues get dropped, which mostly drops a bunch of references to things 
that no longer matter, along with the scheduler and scheduler entity.
- The entity already has a reference to the scheduler in the abstraction 
(to meet the soundness requirement), so the entity necessarily goes 
first. That kills all not yet scheduled jobs, freeing any resources they 
might use.
- Then the scheduler gets torn down, and with my other patch that 
logically kills all in-flight jobs, detaching their hardware fences and 
dropping the job objects. This... still doesn't do much other than drop 
some references that we don't care about.
- At this point, if any jobs are in flight, their firmware objects and 
all of the type hierarchy that goes with them is still alive, as well as 
the firmware queues they're in and the Rust objects representing them, 
the VMs they use, the Events they have been allocated...
- Jobs complete (successfully or fault), then when complete get popped 
off of the Rust-side queue objects that represent the firmware queues.
- When any given FW queue is empty, it relinquishes its assigned 
firmware event ID. That causes the event system to drop its owner 
reference to it, which means the queue itself gets dropped (since the 
UAPI Queue that also held a reference is gone). That then also drops a 
reference to what I call the GpuContext.
- To avoid deadlocks, completed job objects are freed in another thread 
(ugly hack right now, should be done better in the future). Eventually 
as that happens, any resources they reference are dropped, including 
some shared ones that are logically tied to the scheduler/queues, 
references to the MMU VM address space, references to the VM slot that 
address space is assigned to, objects allocated out of user VM space, 
everything. Refcounts everywhere for anything shared, direct ownership 
of child structures for anything that isn't (work buffers, firmware 
command lists, etc.). I once tried to make a slide of the references and 
pointers involved in just the vertex half of a single GPU job and... 
even just that was quite interesting.
- When the last job completes, that drops the last reference to the VM 
slot, which means the backing VM is logically detached from the GPU MMU 
(this is lazy though, it's still there in practice).
- When the last firmware queue is dropped for a logical queue/sched/etc 
(which means no more jobs are running at the GPU for that context), that 
drops the last reference to the GpuContext. That also gets shoved into 
another thread context for cleanup to avoid deadlocks with fault recovery.
- When that is finally cleaned up, a firmware command is sent to 
invalidate the GpuContext. I'm still figuring out what that does and 
what the lifetime rules are here (this is the only explicit invalidation 
command that exists), but as of yesterday I know that at the very least 
we need to keep hold of any Tiled Vertex Buffer associated with it until 
after inval, so that now has a reference to it that gets dropped after 
the firmware acknowledges the invalidation (unless it's a 
non-render-capable Queue, then no TVB necessary).
- When the Buffer gets dropped, that frees both its backing memory and 
(virtual) page list structures, which are in user VM space, as well as 
some kernel firmware objects.
- If things have happened in the order I listed here, those will be the 
last allocations in the two user VM space heap object allocators, so 
those now get dropped, which drops the mappings of their backing GEM 
objects, unmapping them from the MMU VM page tables.
- Those mappings will now be the last references to the actual MMU VM 
object, so that it gets destroyed (the lazy detach comes into effect 
here, PT base address is removed from the VM context base table, full 
ASID invalidate, etc.), which with it drops the IoPgTable that backs it, 
which frees the page tables.
- Then finally the GEM objects backing the userspace allocators get 
dropped as well, which will be the last reference to them, so those get 
freed.

I probably got more than one thing wrong there, and there's layers of 
complexity I glossed over, but that's the rough idea ^^

* If we need to fix this then we're going to need some kind of signal 
from the DRM core that this is happening and it's not normal 
user-triggered GEM closing, and it's going to be interesting... it also 
means we need some kind of mechanism to transfer responsibility over 
those mappings to all in-flight jobs themselves, because normally 
userspace is strictly responsible for all mappings in an explicit sync 
VM bind style world, and now we're adding a special case where we freeze 
the state of the VM until all in-flight jobs are done when the File goes 
away instead of eagerly freeing things. That's a very weird departure 
from how the whole thing normally works, so if we really want that I'm 
going to have to think of how to do it reasonably. It might be easier 
once we implement the full VM map range tracking which will likely flip 
the VM<->GEM object relationship around a bit.
