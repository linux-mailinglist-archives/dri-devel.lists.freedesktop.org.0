ATM the kernel basically only supports a bunch of different methods
to control the backlight of 1 internal panel. The plan is to tie this
to the panel from a userspace pov by making the brightness +
max_brightness properties on the drm_connector object for the
internal-panel.

The in kernel tying of the backlight device to the internal panel
will be done hardcoded inside the drm driver(s) based on the
drivers already knowing which connector is the internal panel.

This all naively assumes there is only 1 internal panel, which
for the majority of cases is true. My plan for devices with
2 internal panels is to cross that bridge when we get there
(I expect those mostly in phone/tablet like devices for now
which will likely use devicetree where solving this is trivial).

I do realize we will eventually get some x86/acpi device with
2 internal panels. Hopefully we can just figure out what
the Windows drivers are doing there and parse e.g. the ACPI
info which Windows is using for this.

As part of the move to properties on the drm_connector object
the /sys/class/backlight interface will become deprecated,
but will be kept for backward compat and will eventually
be put behind a Kconfig option.

The kernel internal backlight_device stuff will be kept
since we need some internal representation anyways and
I don't see much value in reworking that, esp. since
we need to have /sys/class/backlight backward compat.

Note this is all based on discussions which I had with
mainly Daniel Vetter @plumbers 2019 in Lisabon. I have
never gotten around to actually start working on this,
but this has resurfaced recently and I plan to actually
take a stab at implementing this plan sometime during 2022.

> Iâm not sure Iâm aware of any driver-agnostic ways of identifying a particular panel instance uniquely, and if there is one, that would actually help with something else Iâm working on at the moment. If the idea involves e.g. the EDID, that could be troublesome for backlight drivers such as this one which arenât associated with any GPU.

Right, see above the main idea is to make this
"the kernel's problem" and I expect us to fix this in
the kernel in a variety of different ways depending on
the actual hardware.

As for "troublesome for backlight drivers such as this one
which arenât associated with any GPU.", the idea is that:

1. E.g the i915 driver (which I have the most experience with)
knows which connector is the internal panel

2. The acpi_video_get_backlight_type() helper from
drivers/acpi/video_detect.c will get extended to make sure
that there is always only *1* /sys/class/backlight device.

To be specific atm code supporting old vendor specific backlight
fw interfaces, e.g. drivers/platform/x86/dell-laptop.c:
already does:

       if (acpi_video_get_backlight_type() != acpi_backlight_vendor)
                return 0;

And drivers/acpi/acpi_video.c also already does:

       if (acpi_video_get_backlight_type() != acpi_backlight_video)
                return 0;

Currently looking at the 3 main x86 backlight interfaces: vendor,
generic-ACPI and native-drm-driver, only the native driver's
backlight registers unconditionally. The plan is to make those also
do a similar check (*) and to also add special backlight drivers like
nvidia-wmi-ec-backlight and drivers/video/backlight/apple_bl.c
to this mechanism.

3. 1 + 2 means that the drm_driver can just tie the single
backlight_device which will be registered on the system to
the internal panel.

Again I'm completely ignoring dual-internal-panel devices here
for simplicity's sake.

Note this is getting a bit off-topic, but if you have insights
in this, or already can think of ways how this is not going to
work :)  please let me know.


*) And adding that check + the presence of nvidia-wmi-ec-backlight
support will make the native drm-driver not register it's
backlight_device at all at which point the backlight-proxy workaround
from this patch breaks.


> This also gives me an idea for another experiment I didnât think to try earlier. Alex: what happens if you hack amdgpu_atombios_encoder_init_backlight() in the amdgpu driver to just return right away? I wonder if the AMD GPUâs attempt to take over backlight control is what makes the firmware give control to the GPU rather than the EC initially.

> Regardless of the backlight proxy workaround, does the force refresh one seem reasonable? That one at least addresses a condition that happens at every suspend/resume cycle.

Good question, I must admit I stopped reading the patch after seeing
the proxy thing.

I see that you are using a pm_notifer for this. I wonder if you
can try (on your own system) to add a pm_ops struct and make
wmi_driver.driver.pm point to that and check if that gets called
by adding e.g. a pr_info (I don't see why it would not get called).

And assuming that works, using that would be a bit cleaner IMHO.
Although that does have resume-ordering implications. But I would
expect the EC to basically be always ready to get talked to at
the point in the resume cycle where normal (non early) resume
handlers are called.

To be clear the idea would be to always have the suspend handler
(so that the driver and pm_ops structs can be const) and to check
a quirk flag inside the resume handler. Or maybe even just always
read back the brightness from the hw and check if it has changed?
Does this need to be behind a quirk ?

Poking the mux *shouldnât* have any effect on what device is controlling the backlight for the panel, since when the system is in dynamic mux mode the EC is always supposed to be in control, but this system is already showing some weird behavior, so it doesnât hurt to try.

Right, as you said the EC is always supposed to be in control, but
it is not. I would not be surprised if making the ACPI call to put
things in dynamic mode (even though they already are) fixes this,
assuming there is such an ACPI call...

I also have a dump of his ACPI tables, and can check there for some other potential leads. Hopefully whatever changes the state across the suspend/resume cycle is response to something that Linux does or doesnât do, and not some state that is only handled internally within the firmware.

Great, thank you.

Hans
