--- Comment #103 from Peter Hercek <phercek@gmail.com> ---
I boot in BIOS mode and I'm still getting these errors. Though they are rar=
e in
my case with the "better" kernels (around once a week).

Just a note: There were tearing errors in windows drivers of Radeon VII too.
One of the reasons for it was different refresh rate for different monitors.
They recommended to set all refresh rates to 60 Hz or its multiple till it =
is
fixed. In my case it is not completely possible (one monitor supports 60 Hz,
but other two monitors support only 59.95 Hz). I have slight difference in =
the
frequencies.
