The freedesktop Patchwork seems to have a "feature" where in some cases the
submitter for a series changes randomly to a person who did not actually
submit a version of the series.

Not sure but this changed submitter seems to be a maintainer:

------------------------------------------------
https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/series/108156/

Original submission by badal.nilawar@intel.com and subsequent submissions
by me (ashutosh.dixit@intel.com) but current submitter is
jani.nikula@linux.intel.com.

For the above series I believe the submitter changed at v7 where perhaps a
rebuild or a retest was scheduled (not sure if Jani did it and that changed
something) but the build failed at v7. Also note root msg-id's for v6 and
v7 are the same.
------------------------------------------------
https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/series/108091/

Original submission by me (ashutosh.dixit@intel.com) but current submitter
is rodrigo.vivi@intel.com.

Similarly here submitter seems to have changed at v3 where again the build
failed. Also note root msg-id's for v2 and v3 are the same.
------------------------------------------------

The problem this change of submitter causes is that if the actual original
submitter wants to schedule a retest they cannot do it using the retest
button.

Thanks.
