This is the old sentence from v1 again, did you accidentally send the
wrong patch as the improvements from v2 are missing?

At least teardown is one word again, v2 had "tear down" which is wrong.

discussed* as pointed out by Dmitry, and make it clear that this is
about clearing CTL_DSC_ACTIVE (and CTL_DSC_FLUSH?) specifically.  Once
that is moved to reset_intf_cfg(), this patch should be reverted as
there is no need to write the registers once again when cfg->dsc equals
0.
