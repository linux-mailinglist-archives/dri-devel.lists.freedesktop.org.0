More precisely, the semantics of "extern inline" functions changed
between ISO C90 and ISO C99.

That's the only concern I have, which I doubt is an issue. The kernel
is already covered by the function attribute as you note.

Just to have some measure:
$ git grep -rn "extern inline" | wc -l
116

Most of those are in arch/alpha/ which is curious; I wonder if those
were intentional.

(I do worry about Makefiles that completely reset KBUILD_CFLAGS
though; the function attributes still take precedence).

Ack; I think we can just fix this in clang.

I agree. With the fixup to s/Werror/Wextra.
