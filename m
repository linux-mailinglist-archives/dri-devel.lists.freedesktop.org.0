FWIW I've long thought that cleaning up the phy situation in dw-hdmi 
would be a good idea. It's always seemed a bit sketchy that on RK3328 we 
still validate modes against the tables for the Synopsys phy which isn't 
relevant, and if that does allow a clock rate through that the actual 
phy rejects then things just go horribly wrong and the display breaks.

Conceptually I don't think there's any issue with the HDMI node being 
its own phy provider where appropriate. At the DT level it should simply 
be a case of having both sets of properties, e.g.:

	&hdmi {
		#phy-cells = <0>;
		phys = <&hdmi>;
	};

And at the driver level AFAICS it's pretty much just a case of dw-hdmi 
additionally registering itself as a phy provider if the internal phy is 
present - the only difference then should be that it can end up calling 
back into itself via the common phy API rather than directly via 
internal special-cases.
