Yes, it is nice to set the IRQF_NO_AUTOEN flag rather than calling the 
disable_irq().

Indeed, the &drm_dp_aux.wait_hpd_asserted() help confirm the HPD state 
before doing AUX transfers. I will add it in the next version.

I would also like to remove the CONFIG_PM related check, which would 
make the code more concise. And I believe that it would be a good idea 
to remove it and wait until there is a user who actually needs it.

It may be better to drop the 'complex' check about CONFIG_PM and just 
keep using 'devm' as mentioned above.

Yeah, I find the comment in the definition of 
pm_runtime_use_autosuspend() and I will remove it in the next version.

Yes, I believe there is a small bug in the commit mentioned above and I 
will add a separate patch to fix it.

Yeah, the analogix_dp_remove() is not needed based on the above discussion.
