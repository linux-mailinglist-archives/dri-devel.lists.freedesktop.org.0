The proxied host fence isn't directly related to sync objects, though I
prepared code such that it could be extended with a proxied fence later
on, based on a prototype that was made some time ago.

The proxied host fence shouldn't require UAPI changes, but only
virtio-gpu proto extension. Normally, all in-fences belong to a job's
context, and thus, waits are skipped by the guest kernel. Hence, fence
proxying is a separate feature from sync objects, it can be added
without sync objects.

Sync objects primarily wanted by native context drivers because Mesa
relies on the sync object UAPI presence. It's one of direct blockers for
Intel and AMDGPU drivers, both of which has been using this sync object
UAPI for a few months and now wanting it to land upstream.
