So if I understand correctly, drm_panic would pre-allocate a 
plane/commit, and use that when a panic occurs ?
I have two concern about this approach:
- How much memory would be allocated for this ? a whole framebuffer can 
be big for just this use case.
- I find it risky to completely reconfigure the hardware in a panic handler.

Also how many drivers would need this ?

Currently I was mostly considering x86 platform, so:

simpledrm/ast/mgag200 which works well with the get_scanout_buffer().

i915/amdgpu/nouveau, which are quite complex, and will need to do their 
own thing anyway.

It was mentioned by Noralf, about the amdgpu driver:

https://lore.kernel.org/dri-devel/d233c376-ed07-2127-6084-8292d313dac7@amd.com/

They have a slow "debug interface" that you can write to, and can be 
used for the panic handler. It's not memory mapped, so you have to write 
pixels one by one.

So for the struct drm_scanout_buffer, I can add a function pointer to a 
write_pixel(u32 x, u32 y, u32 color)
So if the iosys map is null, it will use that instead.
