I am not sure if we can conclude like that. Even if we shut off the 
controller when the framebuffer was still being fetched that should only 
cause a blank screen and not a reset because we really don't trigger a 
new register write / read while its fetching so as such there is no new 
hardware access.

One thing I must accept is that there are two differences between 
sc8280xp where we are hitting these resets and sc7180/sc7280 chromebooks 
where we tested it more thoroughly without any such issues:

1) with the chromebooks we have depthcharge and not the QC UEFI.

If we are suspecting a hand-off issue here, will it help if we try to 
disable the display in EFI by using "fastboot oem select-display-panel 
none" (assuming this is a fastboot enabled device) and see if you still 
hit the reset issue?

2) chromebooks used "internal_hpd" whereas the pmic_glink method used in 
the sc8280xp.

I am still checking if there are any code paths in the eDP/DP driver 
left exposed due to this difference with pm_runtime which can cause 
this. I am wondering if some sort of drm tracing will help to narrow 
down the reset point.

So this error I think is because in dp_parser_parse() ---> 
dp_parser_ctrl_res(), we also have a devm_phy_get().

This can return -EDEFER if the phy driver has not yet probed.

I checked the other things inside dp_parser_parse(), others calls seem 
to be purely DT parsing except this one. I think to avoid the confusion, 
we should move devm_phy_get() outside of DT parsing into a separate call 
or atleast add an error log inside devm_phy_get() failure below to 
indicate that it deferred

         io->phy = devm_phy_get(&pdev->dev, "dp");
         if (IS_ERR(io->phy))
                 return PTR_ERR(io->phy);

If my hypothesis is correct on this, then this error log (even though 
misleading) should be harmless for this issue because if we hit 
DRM_ERROR("device tree parsing failed\n"); we will skip the 
devm_pm_runtime_enable().
