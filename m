Bah, I checked if Bjorn had hit this with his recent A690 v3 series and
posted a fix, but did not look further than that.

That looks like it would work too, but I think I prefer my version which
keeps the initialisation of the GMU struct in a6xx_gmu_init().

Dmitry or Rob, could you see to that either version gets merged soon so
that we don't end up with even more people having to debug and fix the
same issue?

Johan
