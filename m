KMS clients support XRGB8888, many of them will realistically never support RGB888. (Or even if they did, they might prefer XRGB8888 anyway, if RGB888 requires a final conversion step)

At least on my Matrox system, the conversion is really negligible 
compared to the copy, due to slow memory bandwidth. I wasn't able to see 
a difference, using ktime_get_ns().

The CPU is an old Intel(R) Core(TM) i3 CPU 540  @ 3.07GHz
in 1280x1024, the RGB888 copy takes 95ms.
and the XRGB8888->RGB888 takes also 95ms.
(and the full XRGB8888 copy takes 125ms)

Also we say "conversion", but when talking about XRGB8888->RGB888, there 
is no math involved, only dropping one bytes every 4.

But really performance is not the main concern here as it is obvious 
that it's much faster in RGB888. I tried to summarize the other 
arguments below, which I still find not convincing:
  * The driver is already fast enough, if you want faster, buy another GPU.
  * This adds too much complexity in the driver (about ~20 lines of code)
  * It breaks an unwritten rule of not changing the color format inside 
the kernel (which I tried to write with this patch, while adding an 
exception for legitimate use cases, like this one).

But let's admit that this discussion is going nowhere, and that I failed 
to reach a consensus, so I'm now focusing on other things.

Best regards,
