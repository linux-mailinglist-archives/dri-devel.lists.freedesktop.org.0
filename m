Basically, the numbers are in this form in hex:

0xsspppppppp

In the end, we only want the 's' bits.

The matrix multiplication is not giving us perfect results, making some
of KUnit test not pass, This is because the values end up a little bit
off. KUnit expects 0xfe, but this functions is returning 0xfd.

I noticed that before shifting the values to get the 's' bytes the
values were a lot close to what is expected, something like:

0xfdfe287312
    ^
So the rounding part adds 1 to this marked 'f' to round a bit the values
(drm_fixed.h does something similar on drm_fixp2int_round).
Like that:

   0xfdfe287312
+  0x0010000000
   ------------
   0xfe0e287312

That's why the BIT_DEPTH - 4.

After that, the values need to be clamped to not get wrong results when
shifting this s64 and casting it to u8. We clamp it to the minimum
allowed value: 0, and to the maximum allowed value, which in this case
is all the (BIT_DEPTH + 8) bits set to 1, The '+ 8' is to account for
the size of the 's' bits.

After writing this, I think that maybe it would be good to add this
explanation as a comment on the code.

Yes, when developing this code I started using drm_fixed.h, but after a
few iterations it was more of a hindrance than a help.
