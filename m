Oh dear, when I dug around in there I entirely missed that
kvm_try_get_pfn exists, and it's very broken indeed. kvm really needs
to grow a proper mmu notifier.

Another thing I'm wondering right now, the follow_pte();
fixup_user_fault(); follow_pte(); approach does not make any
guarantees of actually being right. If you're sufficiently unlucky you
might race against an immediate pte invalidate between the fixup and
the 2nd follow_pte(). But you can also not loop, because that would
fail to catch permanent faults.

I think the iommu fault drivers have a similar pattern.

What am I missing here? Or is that also just broken. gup works around
this with the slow path that takes the mmap sem and walking the vma
tree, follow_pte/fixup_user_fautl users dont. Maybe mmu notifier based
restarting would help with this too, if done properly.
