Thank you, this helped greatly.

I believe I know why it used to kind-of work for you, but I'm afraid 
this used to work by sheer chance and it does not really work correctly 
for the panel you use, even if the panel likely does show the correct 
content. But, there is a way to make it work properly for the panel you use.

First of all, the pixel clock never really matched the panel-simple.c 
pixel clock for the edt_etml1010g3dra_timing:

$ grep '\<media_disp2_pix\>' 6.12-rc2_summary_postfix
   media_disp2_pix  1  1  0  74250000 ...
                             ^^^^^^^^

$ grep -A 1 edt_etml1010g3dra_timing drivers/gpu/drm/panel/panel-simple.c
static const struct display_timing edt_etml1010g3dra_timing = {
         .pixelclock = { 66300000, 72400000, 78900000 },
                                   ^^^^^^^^

The pixel clock are within tolerance, but there is a discrepancy 
74250000 != 72400000 .

Since commit 94e6197dadc9 ("arm64: dts: imx8mp: Add LCDIF2 & LDB nodes") 
the IMX8MP_VIDEO_PLL1_OUT is set to a very specific frequency of 
1039500000 Hz, which tidily divides by 2 to 519750000 Hz (which is your 
LVDS serializer frequency) and divides by 7 to 74250000 Hz which is your 
LCDIF pixel clock.

This Video PLL1 configuration since moved to &media_blk_ctrl {} , but it 
is still in the imx8mp.dtsi . Therefore, to make your panel work at the 
correct desired pixel clock frequency instead of some random one 
inherited from imx8mp.dtsi, add the following to the pollux DT, I 
believe that will fix the problem and is the correct fix:

&media_blk_ctrl {
    // 506800000 = 72400000 * 7 (for single-link LVDS, this is enough)
    // there is no need to multiply the clock by * 2
    assigned-clock-rates = <500000000>, <200000000>, <0>, <0>, 
<500000000>, <506800000>;
};

Can you please test whether this works and the pixel clock are accurate 
in /sys/kernel/debug/clk/clk_summary ?

Now ... as for the LVDS serializer clock ... that is more complicated.

The LCDIF driver does its .atomic_enable first , configures the pixel 
clock (and the Video PLL now) and enables the clock. The LVDS LDB 
serializer driver does its .atomic_enable second and cannot reconfigure 
the clock anymore, the Video PLL is stuck at /7 rate set by LCDIF driver 
and won't budge because the clock are already enabled. I'm currently 
trying to figure out if this can be improved somehow, but I believe that 
would be material for next release.
