(In reply to Wilko Bartels from comment #84)
> nevermind. it crashed on 60hz as well (once) yesterday

It sure does. This bug is now about two years old, during which amdgpu has
never been stable, got worse, and every contemporary kernel, whether "offic=
ial"
ones or ones compiled from git heads of development trees has this very
problem, which I can reproduce within minutes.

I've given up hoping for a fix. I'll buy an Intel Xe GPU as soon as it hits=
 the
shelves.
