So the overall idea here is that a lot of these things cannot be changed
once the vkms_device instance is created, due to how drm works. This is
why struct vmks_config has been extracted. The rough flow would be:

1. you create a new directory in the vkms configfs directory when creating
a new instance. This then gets populated with all the properties from
vkms_config

2. user sets these properts through configfs

3. There is a special property called "registered" or similar, which
starts out as 0/false. When set to 1/true the vkms_device will be
registered with the vkms_config that's been prepared. After that point
further changes to vkms_config are not allowed anymore at all (this might
change later on for connector hotplug, which really is the only thing a
drm_device can change at runtime).

4. removal of the vkms_device could perhaps be done simply be deleting the
entire directory? I think that would be a nice clean interface.

So in other words, basing the configfs interface on drm objects doesn't
work, because once the drm objects exist you cannot change the
configuration anymore.
