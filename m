It doesn't sorts them out, but it is a good helper to have in the toolbox.

The key point is it allows a debugger to not only suspend the CPU 
threads, peek/pook into the address space etc..., but also interact with 
the kernel device driver in the same way as the debugged application would.

So you can for example do things mmap() KMS handles to inspect scanned 
out images, or do things like command submission in the context of the 
debugged application etc....

At least for us that made in unnecessary to work with a parasitic thread 
injected into the debugged application, e.g. it avoided the need for the 
debugger to run code in the context of the debugged application.

You still need to define the approach, UAPI etc.. but you don't have to 
worry about access restrictions any more because that is already check 
by pidfd_getfd() and can implement you debugging UAPI just as normal 
driver IOCTLs on the DRM render node.

Regards,
Christian.
