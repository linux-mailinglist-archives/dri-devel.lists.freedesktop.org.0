Thanks Oak,
Either should be fine and up to user how to use vm_bind/unbind out-fence.

With GPU page faults handler, out fence won't be needed as residency is
purely managed by page fault handler populating page tables (there is a
mention of it in GPU Page Faults section below).

>Should we document such thing?

We don't talk much about GPU page faults case in this document as that may
warrent a separate rfc when we add page faults support. We did mention it
in couple places to ensure our locking design here is extensible to gpu
page faults case.
