Auxiliary devices are created as children of a parent device. When
multiple instances of the same parent type exist, this will be reflected
in the /sys/devices/ devices tree hierarchy without any issue. The
problem comes from the fact the the auxiliary devices need a unique name
for /sys/bus/auxialiary/devices/, where we somehow have to differenciate
devices of identical types.

Essentially, we're trying to summarize a whole hierarchy (path in
/sys/devices/) into a single string. There are different ways to solve
this. For platform devices, we use a device ID. For I2C devices, we use
the parent's bus number. Other buses use different schemes.

Geert's patch implements a mechanism in the ti-sn65dsi86 driver to
handle this, and assign an id managed by the parent. In a sense we could
consider this to be similar to what is done for I2C, where the bus
number is also a property of the parent. However, the big difference is
that the I2C bus number is managed by the I2C subsystem, while here the
id is managed by the ti-sn65dsi86 driver, not by the auxiliary device
core. This would require duplicating the same mechanism in every single
driver creating auxiliary devices. This strikes me as a fairly bad idea.
The problem should be solved by the core, not by individual drivers.
