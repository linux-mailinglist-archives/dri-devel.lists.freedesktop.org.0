messages

Happened again today, while playing GTA V. Same problems appear in the log
(attached). 

I think the title of this bug should be changed, there is more going on here
then just dropping the signal to the monitor. Because the monitors connected to
the iGPU freeze as well (no signal drop, just a freeze).

It would be great if someone could give me some pointers as to where I could
find more useful logs. /var/log/messages doesn't seem to be very informative.
It just says a GPU reset began and that it failed to sends some messages after.
Or do I maybe need to set some boot parameters, or kernel configs to get more
verbose logs?
