4K HDMI output from hdmi need very carefully tuningÂ  of HDMI PHY and PLL.

I can make sure that HDMI 4K output on rk3399/rk3288/rk356x are work 
fine with our

vendor kernel, but the upstream kernel is only can run at 1080p output, 
I have tested

on rk3399 and rk3568-evb1[0]


I am notÂ  familiar with hdmi tuning, so I am sorry i can't give detail 
idea about this issue,

maybe a more carefully comparison with hdmi driver and pll 
configurationÂ  between upstream kernel and rockchip 4.19 kernel?

I think you have rk356x evb board, do you have a detail test about 4K 
HDMI output with this board? If you have issue about 4k hdmi output

on this board with rockchip 4.19 kernel, we can help to figure it out.

Anyway, I loop Algea to the list, he is maintaining our hdmi 
development, but I am sorry to say that he is

also very busyðŸ˜…

I don't have a rock3a, so I can't confirm the problem you described on 
4.19 kernel.
