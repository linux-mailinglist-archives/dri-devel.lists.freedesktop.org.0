There are at least three states: On/Off/HiZ .

Currently the DT description isn't acually rich enough to allow drivers
to safely use the HiZ state so that is not why this change is potentially
useful today (but does illustrate why it is not "wrong" to put it on the
h/ware description).

Modern DT practice is to for the display to link to backlight. This
gives display control over power state (so backlight automatically
follows the display power state). On such systems the backlight will
be turned "on" when the display hardware comes up (regardless of whether
or not default-on is set).

Thus this control covers the case where we have a display that is
readable when the GPIO is off (e.g. transflexive LCD or epaper).
A display that is readable with the GPIO off means the default
brightness brightness at boot can meaningfully be zero. In this
case the backlight is nominally on but the GPIO is off.

In short, this becomes part of the hardware description, rather than
merely being a driver feature, due to the effect of linking display
to backlight in the DT.

Note also that most backlights do expose on/off via DT for the same
reasons (when the off and zero states both result in the backlight
output pin doing physically the same thing).

It may be potentially useful for people building kit with sunlight
readable displays and trivial backlights as a backup in the dark.

Of course if the pin the backlight is connected to is PWM capable
then the PWM backlight is probably a better bet ;-) .
