As per the comment from Lijo,
https://lore.kernel.org/all/aa23f0ef-a4ab-ca73-5ab3-ef23d6e36e89@amd.com/

the errors are grouped per bitmask, they are not expecting a separation
at netlink level.

<31:24> = Block Id
<23:16> subblock id
<15:8> - interested instance
<7:0> - error_type

The interface shouldÂ  support errors per IP block and instance, which
the current series support via DRM_RAS_CMD_READ_BLOCK.
when driver receives the command DRM_RAS_CMD_READ_BLOCK it is supposed
to decipher the bits based on the above bitsmask.
The query command is expected to list the blocks and instances
available, the counters of which will be read via DRM_RAS_CMD_READ_BLOCK.

sounds interesting and I feel it looks clean too. But that does mean we
completely handle
the netlink framework inside the drm layer and not at the driver and
expose callback ops to
drm drivers.

Thanks,

Our hardware supports RAS(Reliability, Availability, Serviceability) by
reporting the errors to the host, which the KMD processes and exposes a
set of error counters which can be used by observability tools to take 
corrective actions or repairs. Traditionally there were being exposed 
via PMU (for relative counters) and sysfs interface (for absolute 
value) in our internal branch. But, due to the limitations in this 
approach to use two interfaces and also not able to have an event based 
reporting or configurability, an alternative approach to try netlink 
was suggested by community for drm subsystem wide UAPI for RAS and 
telemetry as discussed in [2]. 

This [2] is the inspiration to this series. It uses the generic
netlink(genl) family subsystem and exposes a set of commands that can
be used by every drm driver, the framework provides a means to have
custom commands too. Each drm driver instance in this example xe driver
instance registers a family and operations to the genl subsystem through
which it enumerates and reports the error counters. An event based
notification is also supported to which userpace can subscribe to and
be notified when any error occurs and read the error counter this avoids
continuous polling on error counter. This can also be extended to
threshold based notification.

But before going to the ideas below I'd like to also raise the naming issue

I was recently running some experiments to devlink with this and similar

way too much centric on network devices and any addition there to our
GPU RAS would be a heavy lift. But, there are some good things from there
that we could perhaps get inspiration from.

Starting from the name. devlink is the name of the tool and the name
of the framework. It uses netlink on the back, but totally abstracting
that. Here in this version we can see:
drm_ras: the tool
drm_netlink: the abstraction
drm_genl_*: the wrapper?</pre>
