--- Comment #8 from tempel.julian@gmail.com ---
Could we get an update on this?
Apparently AMD_DEBUG=3Dnodma makes the corruption completely disappear, so =
it
seems the issue really is caused by asynchronous DMA.

If the cause of the issue is not easy to find, perhaps disable async DMA by
default? It doesn't seem to affect performance at all (at least not in wine=
d3d
and Gallium Nine) and it doesn't look like a good idea to me to have corrup=
tion
in a vast number of games by default.
