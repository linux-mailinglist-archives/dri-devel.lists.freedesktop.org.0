The problem then becomes how to change the effective bpc to the maximum value?

It seems to me like the "max bpc" property is just kind of bad API, and trying to tweak it to cater to more use cases as we discover them will take us down a rabbit hole. It seems better to replace it with new properties which allow user space to determine the current effective bpc and to explicitly control it.
