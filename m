Yes, I'm aware of this limitation.

Let me quickly try to explain where this limitation comes from and how I 
intend to address it.

In order to be able to allocate the required page tables for a mapping 
request and in order to free corresponding page tables once the (async) 
job finished I need to know the corresponding sequence of operations 
(drm_gpuva_ops) to fulfill the mapping request.

This requires me to update the GPUVA space in the ioctl() rather than in 
the async stage, because otherwise I would need to wait for previous 
jobs to finish before being able to submit subsequent jobs to the job 
queue, since I need an up to date view of the GPUVA space in order to 
calculate the sequence of operations to fulfill a mapping request.

As a consequence all jobs need to be processed in the order they were 
submitted, including synchronous jobs.

@Matt: I think you will have the same limitation with synchronous jobs 
as your implementation in XE should be similar?

In order to address it I want to switch to using callbacks rather than 
'pre-allocated' drm_gpuva_ops and update the GPUVA space within the 
asynchronous stage. This would allow me to 'fit' synchronous jobs 
between jobs waiting in the async job queue. However, to do this I have 
to re-work how the page table handling in Nouveau is implemented, since 
this would require me to be able to manage the page tables without 
knowing the exact sequence of operations to fulfill a mapping request.
