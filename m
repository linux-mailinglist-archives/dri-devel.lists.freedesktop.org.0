Errors-To: dri-devel-bounces@lists.freedesktop.org
Sender: "dri-devel" <dri-devel-bounces@lists.freedesktop.org>

Specifically document the new/clarified rules around how the shared
fences do not have any ordering requirements against the exclusive
fence.

But also document all the things a bit better, given how central
struct dma_resv to dynamic buffer management the docs have been very
inadequat.

- Lots more links to other pieces of the puzzle. Unfortunately
  ttm_buffer_object has no docs, so no links :-(

- Explain/complain a bit about dma_resv_locking_ctx(). I still don't
  like that one, but fixing the ttm call chains is going to be
  horrible. Plus we want to plug in real slowpath locking when we do
  that anyway.

- Main part of the patch is some actual docs for struct dma_resv.

Overall I think we still have a lot of bad naming in this area (e.g.
dma_resv.fence is singular, but contains the multiple shared fences),
but I think that's more indicative of how the semantics and rules are
just not great.

Another thing that's real awkard is how chaining exclusive fences
right now means direct dma_resv.exclusive_fence pointer access with an
rcu_assign_pointer. Not so great either.
