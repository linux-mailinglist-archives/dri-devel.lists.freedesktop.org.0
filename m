Like I said, CTS is mentioning 10ms to finish link training after the 
DUT writes 00h to the TRAINING_PATTERN_SET byte. So for this discussion 
lets leave out CTS for now.

Let me re-explain if I didnt make this clear last time.

You are right. Thats all the "userspace" can do which is basically retry 
the mode. And like I said, its again only going to fail. All the 
corrective actions you mentioned below like ignoring the connector 
entirely or consider that the display has link training problems are not 
something we decided to go with on a commercial device where we expect 
things to be more reliable.

Let me re-explain what I explained in the prev response.

If driver issues hot-plug after link-training:

It would have implemented all the link training mechanisms such as 
trying lower rates/number of lanes and made sure that when the usermode 
queries the list of modes, only the modes which fit into the link rate 
which was link trained successfully will be exposed and the chances of a 
user ending up with a blank screen on connection are pretty high.

This reduces the dependency on usermodes to be smart enough to implement 
such policies and we would rather not depend on those unless we have 
some reference to a compositor which is more sturdy. I do not think the 
CrOS code you have pointed to is more sturdy than the driver mechanism 
explained above.

As opposed to this, if we just issue hotplug without any of this, 
usermode does not know which mode to retry as we do not remove or edit 
the mode list once link training fails.

What gain will it give if it retries the same mode blindly as opposed to 
the safer option I have explained above. None of the policies you have 
highlighted seem like something an end user will be satisfied with.

Usermode is unable to take the corrective action without proper support 
from the kernel like removing unsupported modes etc and I dont see other 
drivers taking an action like that. Kernel is not lying. Its delaying 
the status to a point where usermode can safely handle.

Please explain to me how any of the policies you have explained usermode 
can take are safer and have more chance of success than what we have now.
