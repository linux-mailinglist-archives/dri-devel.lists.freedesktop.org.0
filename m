Only reason I converted the function at all was really for uniformity's
sake. But I don't think that's valid anymore seeing how there's already
other mipi_dsi funtions that I'm not converting and this function
probably wouldn't show up in the context of the other multi
functions.

One thing that struck me as odd was that the callers of
mipi_dsi_dcs_get_display_brightness never bothered to print errors at
all? If we want to print errors for non-multi functions, then I think it
would be best to just modify the existing function. And in the case that
someone doesn't want those errors showing up, I agree with what Maxime
said [2] and let users handle it.
