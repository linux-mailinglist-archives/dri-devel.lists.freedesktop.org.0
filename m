Hi Linus, Daniel, Konstantin,

@Linus, Daniel: Thank you both for your replies!

@Konstantin: I have one question for you at the end of this email if you
don't mind.

That would be a nice behaviour indeed. That's just a shame it means we
cannot use the default behaviour of these bug trackers and we need a
dedicated bot instead. I don't know what's the behaviour with GitLab and
other bug trackers but with GitHub, when a commit is seen in a public
repo with a "Link:" tag pointing to an issue, a "special" comment is
added to the bug report but no notifications are sent. So if we don't
implement the bot you described, we will still have to do the tracking
manually.

I understand we can see that as an issue with the existing service but
it also means we cannot use their build-in automations.

Maybe it means we have to switch to Bugzilla and wait for the new bot :)
(but no, I don't want to add pressure on Konstantin ;) )

Here, "Closes:" would be used exclusively with a URL to a specific bug
report, not just "Closes: #1234". Would this not work if different
subsystems use it?

An extra check could be added to checkpatch.pl to display a warning if
this "Closes:" tag is not used with a URL.

In the case of GitHub -- and GitLab if I'm not mistaken -- there are
some safeguards: the closure is only done if a commit having the
"Closes:" tag to the bug report is applied into a specific branch. In
other words, if someone applies the same patch elsewhere, the bug report
will not be closed automatically. Also in case of closure, a
notification is also sent and the bug report can be re-opened if
something wrong happened.

I understand the risks of being misused by some and I guess the main
point here is that we want to avoid exceptions.

On our side with MPTCP, if we can definitively no longer use the
"Closes:" tag, we will find alternatives. Probably by rewriting patches
containing them before sending patches to netdev. This way we can
continue to use the feature internally and when sent upstream, the
commits will contain Fixes tag instead :)


So correct me if I'm wrong but the conclusion is then to stop using the
"Closes:" tag to avoid misuses. In this case, we can of course drop this
series.

@Konstantin: would it be OK for your future Bugzilla bot to deal with
the generic "Link:" tag instead of the specific "Closes:" one?

Cheers,
Matt
