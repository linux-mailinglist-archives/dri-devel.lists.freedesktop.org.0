Hello Doug,

Thanks for the review.

I am trying to add display support for TI SoC which uses this particular
bridge. While debugging, I was trying to get all the register value in
sync with the datasheet and it was then that I observed this issue while
inspecting the code.
Maybe Chromebooks are using different set of parameters which does not
expose this issue. Since parameters for my display (mentioned in commit
message) yields the frequency at the border, I saw this issue. My debug
is still ongoing but since the value is not in sync with the
documentation, I sent out this patch.

Yes, ideally they should still work well with this change.

Check should be done before propagating the register value so I added it
in the same function and hence in the same patch.

Yes. Now I see that it fixes the initial support patch.
I will fix that.

The comment above does specify the inclusive/exclusive behavior.
Since a value corresponds to 5MHz range, associating the value with
the range makes more sense if I keep it 0x97 (0x97 * 5 -> 755MHz)
0x96 corresponds to the range of [750Mz,755MHz).

If this argument does not make sense, I can change it to 0x96 and handle
it with the inequalities in the function call.

I did use reverse calculation for the value that I used in comments. xD

Okay. This makes sense. Will take this into account for v2.

Oops.
I will handle it how we are handling errors in case of link_training:
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/gpu/drm/bridge/ti-sn65dsi86.c#L1152

That should be okay I guess?
