Uh, that's a _much_ more fundamental issue.

The fix for that is telling the driver core about this dependency with
device_link_add. Unfortuantely, despite years of me trying to push for
this, drm_bridge and drm_panel still don't automatically add these,
because the situation is a really complex mess.

Probably need to read dri-devel archives for all the past attempts around
device_link_add.

But the solution is definitely not to have a manually tracked list, what's
very architectural unsound way to tackle this problem.

Oh the issue is very real and known since years. It also wreaks module
unload and driver unbinding, since currently nothing makes sure your
drm_panel lives longer than your drm_device.

You've stepped into an entire hornets nest with this device dependency
issue unfortunately, I'm afraid :-/
