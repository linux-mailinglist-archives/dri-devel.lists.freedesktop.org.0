--- Comment #1 from Richard Thier <u9vata@gmail.com> ---
Created attachment 144510
  --> https://bugs.freedesktop.org/attachment.cgi?id=3D144510&action=3Dedit
Second screenshot (visible tile boundary - zbuffer is completely wasted bel=
ow)

Added second screenshot. You can see the tile here where the blue gear is.
Above the line that tile starts and above the line from the next tile-line
there is good z-buffer always.

Here I am after some seconds so the whole zbuffer became unusable at this p=
oint
and that is why things are black. In games that have a skybox I tend to see=
 the
skybox instead or far away things instead of black!

Resolution is 1024x768 so you can even measure the size of the tile. I thin=
k it
is 32x32 or similar.
