Yes, Imagine if a bussiness with 100 linux workstations went for Navi cards=
 and
faced these issues... it would be a tremendous loss for them, I really don't
think that this was fair to AMD Linux customers at all, but calling them na=
mes
won't get us anywhere.

and just as we speak about that I had a random SDMA hang in Firefox, they a=
re
way less frequent in FF now, but very much still present.
