It would still be an abstraction of the hardware, just that the level
of abstraction is a bit "lower" than your intuition currently tells you
we should have. IMO it's not too different from the kernel providing low
level input events describing what what the hardware can do and does,
with a rather massive user space library (libinput) turning all of that
low level nonsense to actual useful abstractions.

In this case it's the other way around, the kernel provides vendor
independent knobs that describe what the output hardware can do, and
exactly how it does it, and a userspace library turns that into a
different and perhaps more useful abstraction.

I realize input and output is dramatically different, just making a
point about the level of abstraction that is ideal is not necessary "the
more the better".

Compositors will want to switch between using the KMS color pipeline and
using shaders without visible differences at any point in time, or
predictable visible differences. Lets say for example you are playing a
video, and everything bypasses the GPU, and we're saving important power
and all that. Suddenly the user moves the mouse or touches the screen
and we'll suddenly have overlays that make it necessary to stop
bypassing the GPU and start compositing.

These transitions should not result in any visible difference, and that
is hard/impossible to do perfectly if the level of abstraction is too
high, as implementation details of the pipeline would be hidden. The
decisions the kernel had to make to turn the descriptive declaration
into actual hardware configuration wouldn't be predictable or known.

Userspace needs to know how the kernel implements a pipeline, so that it
can decide if it's "good enough" or perhaps even adapt its compositing
to match it so that it can implement non-glitchy offloading. The
compositor should make the decision if pixel perfect transitions is
mandatory or not, it shouldn't be a policy implemented inside the
kernel.

It is also within scope of a library that provides the descriptive API
to also know how to handle the fallback, e.g. by providing shaders that
compositors can use when compositing. The kernel is the wrong place to
generate shaders.

It is true that for a new generation of hardware that changes the color
pipeline in a way that makes existing userspace no longer able to
off-load compositing, needs an updated userspace, but the grand long
term idea is that one wouldn't update all those compositors, but only
the shared library that provides the descriptive API they all (ideally)
make use of. The compositors still handle interacting with KMS
themselves, but would share this helper library that can help
configuring a subset of the knobs KMS provide to their individual needs.

So indeed the kernel isn't doing all the abstraction, it'd be the kernel
together with a userspace library.
