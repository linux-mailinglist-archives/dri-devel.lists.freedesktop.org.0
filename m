That's exactly what I meant with pushing back :)

I wasn't aware that this handling is already implemented.

Yeah, perfect. Exactly that's what's needed here.

 From what you wrote it's already perfectly covered.

Completely agree to this approach.

The only problem is that media players tend to not implement a way to 
allow direct scanout because of those fallback paths.

But as you said that's their decision.
