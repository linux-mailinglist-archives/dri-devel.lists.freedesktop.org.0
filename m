From: Philipp Stanner <pstanner@redhat.com>

drm_sched_backend_ops.run_job() returns a dma_fence for the scheduler.
That fence is signalled by the driver once the hardware completed the
associated job. The scheduler does not increment the reference count on
that fence, but implicitly expects to inherit this fence from run_job().

This is relatively subtle and prone to misunderstandings.

This implies that, to keep a reference for itself, a driver needs to
call dma_fence_get() in addition to dma_fence_init() in that callback.

It's further complicated by the fact that the scheduler even decrements
the refcount in drm_sched_run_job_work() since it created a new
reference in drm_sched_fence_scheduled(). It does, however, still use
its pointer to the fence after calling dma_fence_put() - which is safe
because of the aforementioned new reference, but actually still violates
the refcounting rules.

Move the call to dma_fence_put() to the position behind the last usage
of the fence.

Document the necessity to increment the reference count in
drm_sched_backend_ops.run_job().
