I'm working on a similar issue where the bridge is used to provide a
connector to a display port monitor and hot pluging would be needed.

Related, but not the issue here: We have two display outputs and the
reported connected display without an actual monitor to report a
video mode then confuses the system to also not use the second display.

As I already have a solution which fixes my issue, hopefully not
affecting the eDP use case a proposed that here:
