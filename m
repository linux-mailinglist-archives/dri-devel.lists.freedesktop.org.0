I've finally found where is the problem! It turned out that the issue is 
in the exynos_drm_fimd driver, in the code for enabling the display port 
clock (fimd_dp_clock_enable()
 Â function). It touches FIMD regs, but it was not guarded with FIMD's 
runtime pm calls and after the $subject change it happened that 
exynos_dp/analogix_dp code called the clock enable/disable when FIMD 
driver (which implements the CRTC object) was not runtime resumed. 
Previously all dp clock handling was done when CRTC was enabled, thus 
the FIMD device was in the resumed runtime pm state.

I will send a patch fixing this soon.

Best regards
