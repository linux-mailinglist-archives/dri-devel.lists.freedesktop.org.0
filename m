--- Comment #117 from Duncan (1i5t5.duncan@cox.net) ---
For those on stable-series 5.4 and/or interested in related bugs...

FWIW, there's an (apparently different) atomic_commit_tail bug reported against
5.4.58 now, bug #208913, with the patch for this bug (which went into 5.4.56
after hitting a late 5.8-rc) originally listed as a potential trigger.

But the filer closed the bug and moved it to the gitlab instance on
freedesktop.org https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/1263 , where he
said reverting the patch didn't cure his issue, so there's something else going
on there.

Just posting this here as related, in case anyone here wants to follow it,
since I came across it while checking on a different (not graphics-related) bug
in 5.9-rc1.  With any luck, however, the similar bug will help get a better
longer term fix for both bugs, since the patch in 5.8 (backported to 5.7 and
5.4) was seen as a temporary bandaid, not a permanent fix.
