Hi I'm David and I am working with Pavel on this. We will have something to
share with you on the mailing list before the end of the week.

I'm also preparing a submission for NetDev conf. I wonder if you and others at
Google plan to present there as well? If so, then we may want to coordinate our
submissions and talks (if accepted).

Please let me know this week, thanks!
