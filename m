This series contains the several fixes, making drm/ci much
more reliable and useful.

Highlights:

* Current DRM/CI in drm-misc is broken, this series fixes it with mesa
  uprev (commit 1/9).

* The fails.txt and flakes.txt lists were generated by a bogus script,
  this series restart that initial list from scratch (commit 5/9),
  which reduced considerably the number of flakes.

* Jobs are run in a subset of available DUTs in the Lava farm
  (commit 6/9) to not block merge requests for Mesa3D.

* Add python script update-xfails.py to update the xfails lists
  (commit 3/9).

Tested on https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/helen.fornazier/linux/-/pipelines/1014358

To work properly, the following patches are also required:
