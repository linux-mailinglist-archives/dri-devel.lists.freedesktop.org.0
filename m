dmesg with new bios (7C35v1C3)

Resume from hibernate fails with black screen and unresponsive system after
image loading is completed. If my interpretation of dmesg output is correct it
seems to be related to amdgpu (Radeon 5700 Navi 10 ).
Ssh to machine is possible.

Suspend to memory worked so far. As well as testing levels: freezer, devices,
platform, processors, core to /sys/power/pm_test with disk state according to:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/power/basic-pm-debugging.txt

When triggering hibernation (sys-power/pm-utils-1.4.1-r7) screen goes black but
before power is off it seems to be restored for 1-2 seconds - not sure if that
is normal or important.

I did an update to a newer bios without change of the behavior.

Harware is a MSI X570 board, Ryzen 3700X, 32G and said Radeon RX 5700. 
Further details in dmesg and lspci.
