The point of this series is to change this behavior so I can actually 
use the scheduler in my use case, and that begins with formally 
documenting it as Daniel suggested. That is, I need it to be safe for 
jobs to not be yet complete before the scheduler is destroyed (the 
entities do get destroyed first, that's the first bullet point).

We already had this discussion. Without this guarantee, I cannot build a 
reasonable safe Rust abstraction. Unless you have another suggestion, as 
far as I can tell it's either this or I give up on using the DRM 
scheduler entirely and reimplement something else on my own.

Where was this rejected?

This is just documenting the fact that the DRM scheduler no longer cares 
about the fences after it is destroyed. I can remove it from the docs if 
you want, I don't rely on this behavior.

> IIRC Daniel documented this as mandatory on the dma_fence behavior.

Right, in the general case all dma_fences must be signaled, that's why I 
explicitly said this only applies if the scheduler is the *only* user of 
those fences.

If you don't think this should be a guarantee the scheduler officially 
makes, I'll remove it from the text.
