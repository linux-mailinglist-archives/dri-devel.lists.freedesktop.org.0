I think this is fine - we can use the same kind of subclassing for when we =
add
bridges someday - and could add functions for retrieving references to the
actual unregistered connectors/registered connectors if needed.

Of course, in that case though it's fine to just define an empty object to
subclass - and then the driver can just stick with the Opaque variants of e=
ach
mode object type.

Yep! You don't need to do anything special here, the Mutex provides the
send/sync guarantee and lets you grab a mutable reference to its contained
data.

Does this actually happen in the ->reset callback though? I assumed for
drivers reading in atomic state that this would happen immediately after -
>reset, so my plan was to add a separate hook in the future drivers could u=
se
for reading in hardware state.
