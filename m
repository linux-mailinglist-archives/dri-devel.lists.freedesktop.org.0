What about:

3) You destroy the VM_BO, because the VM is destroyed, but someone else (e.g.
   another VM) holds a reference of this BO, which is dropped concurrently?

Please don't tell me "but MSM doesn't do that". This is generic infrastructure,
it is perfectly valid for drivers to do that.

Exactly, that's why the whole approach of removing the reference count a VM_BO
has on the BO, i.e. the proposed DRM_GPUVM_VA_WEAK_REF is broken.

As mentioned, make it DRM_GPUVM_MSM_LEGACY_QUIRK and get an approval from Dave /
Sima for it.

You can't make DRM_GPUVM_VA_WEAK_REF work as a generic thing without breaking
the whole design and lifetimes of GPUVM.

We'd just end up with tons of traps for drivers with lots of WARN_ON() paths and
footguns like the one above if a driver works slightly different than MSM.
