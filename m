Okay. At the moment the other problem I am thinking about also makes a 
one-internal-panel assumption, and it's true for the particular hardware 
that I'm working with, but I didn't like that assumption. If there isn't 
something existing that can be used to link connectors from multiple 
GPUs together to indicate they actually (potentially) drive the same 
display panel, then I suppose I'll continue assuming that. But I really 
do think the >1 display case needs to be more than just an afterthought, 
even if the solution, for now, is to just have all the drivers agree 
that a single internal panel is e.g. index 0 of some shared table that 
the drivers can all consult so that everybody knows which panel is which.

I am also concerned about muxed designs that don't have an EC-controlled 
backlight. If there's only allowed to be one backlight device per panel, 
then that means vga_switcheroo would have to do something to disable the 
outgoing GPU's backlight control and enable the incoming one's. And then 
all the userspace software that controls the sysfs backlight interfaces 
would need to make sure to check to see what backlight devices are 
exposed every time a brightness change request is made, and not e.g. 
just once at init and then assume that the backlight devices won't 
change over the lifetime of whatever backlight manager software we're 
talking about (e.g. gnome-settings-daemon). I suppose if what the kernel 
exposes is an abstraction so that userspace only sees one backlight 
interface per panel in sysfs at any given time, which might actually be 
connected to one of several different drivers in the backlight 
subsystem, that would make it a little better, but I still think there 
would be potential for races between a mux switch and a brightness 
change event.

I'm not aware of any more modern examples, but there already have been 
such systems. See e.g. Lenovo ThinkPad W701ds. IIRC that system was 
discrete GPU only, so there wouldn't be any concern about coordinating 
panel IDs between different GPU drivers, but there is a very real 
possibility that a vendor may want to bring back a similar design with 
hybrid GPUs. The asymmetry of that system always bothered me a bit: I 
imagine that if the NVIDIA GPUs of that era supported more than two 
heads per GPU, we may have seen a three-screen notebook.

It's very possible that some of the modern exotic e.g. folding designs 
show up as dual displays, but I don't have any first-hand experience 
with those to know whether that is the case. I definitely remember the 
W701ds exposed the two displays as separate entities. (And the one that 
popped off to the side was rotated, which was fun.)

If you have a high-level design for this written down somewhere, do you 
mind sharing it? I want to get an idea of what types of changes the 
proprietary nvidia-drm driver might need to participate in this.

Sure, the NVIDIA proprietary driver knows this as well, and what I've 
seen from the other DRM drivers also suggests that this is an easy 
determination to make.

And part of the problem with this bug is that what the firmware is 
reporting here is a lie, at least until the first suspend/resume cycle.

Also, unlike the DRM drivers, the NVIDIA proprietary driver does not 
register its backlight handler unconditionally: one of the strange 
things about this system is that the NVIDIA proprietary driver *does* 
register a backlight handler, even though it's definitely not supposed 
to in this case. I did notice that the DRM drivers don't currently seem 
to have any checks to see whether they should register, and indeed on 
the EC backlight systems I have tested, with both amdgpu and i915, there 
is a non-functional sysfs backlight interface exposed by the iGPU. One 
of the other strange things about the system is the fact that the amdgpu 
backlight driver works at all.

This sounds kind of ugly to me. If the backlight control is 
GPU-agnostic, as is the case here, then associating the backlight_device 
with a drm_driver doesn't seem right. It sounds like the plan is to move 
from the current sysfs interface to one that's exposed by the DRM 
subsystem. If that's the case, I think there should be a way to do so 
without tying it to a specific GPU driver. e.g., on a muxed system, one 
or the other GPU might be scanning out at any given time (which is why 
many of these systems have non-GPU backlight control), so if the 
interface is GPU-specific, that would be at the very least confusing.

My concerns listed above are everything I can think of off the top of my 
head. I'm sure if I think about it more I'll come up with other 
concerns. This did get a bit off-topic, but I'm actually very glad 
you've told me all this.

Alex: what happens if you hack amdgpu_atombios_encoder_init_backlight() in the amdgpu driver to just return right away? I wonder if the AMD GPUâs attempt to take over backlight control is what makes the firmware give control to the GPU rather than the EC initially.

Okay, thanks. I missed the wmi_driver.driver.pm when I was looking to 
wire up something to refresh the backlight level on resume; that does 
sound cleaner than registering a notifier. Alex did report that the 
backlight was briefly at maximum brightness following resume, before the 
notifier kicked in and reset it to the correct level, so hopefully 
hooking it up through pm_ops will be able to catch it early enough to 
avoid that. And making the refresh unconditional rather than hidden 
behind a quirk sounds reasonable too; I expect it to be harmless on 
systems that don't need it.

Poking the mux *shouldnât* have any effect on what device is controlling the backlight for the panel, since when the system is in dynamic mux mode the EC is always supposed to be in control, but this system is already showing some weird behavior, so it doesnât hurt to try.

Yes, there is one, although changes to the mode aren't supposed to take 
effect until reboot. However, this system already seems to be 
misbehaving, so it's certainly possible that poking at that call will do 
something.

I also have a dump of his ACPI tables, and can check there for some other potential leads. Hopefully whatever changes the state across the suspend/resume cycle is response to something that Linux does or doesnât do, and not some state that is only handled internally within the firmware.
