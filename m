Add an entry for the new uapi needed for small BAR on DG2+.

v2:
  - Some spelling fixes and other small tweaks. (Akeem & Thomas)
  - Rework error capture interactions, including no longer needing
    NEEDS_CPU_ACCESS for objects marked for capture. (Thomas)
  - Add probed_cpu_visible_size. (Lionel)
v3:
  - Drop the vma query for now.
  - Add unallocated_cpu_visible_size as part of the region query.
  - Improve the docs some more, including documenting the expected
    behaviour on older kernels, since this came up in some offline
    discussion.

+==========================
+I915 Small BAR RFC Section
+==========================
+Starting from DG2 we will have resizable BAR support for device local-memory(i.e
+I915_MEMORY_CLASS_DEVICE), but in some cases the final BAR size might still be
+smaller than the total probed_size. In such cases, only some subset of
+I915_MEMORY_CLASS_DEVICE will be CPU accessible(for example the first 256M),
+while the remainder is only accessible via the GPU.
+
+I915_GEM_CREATE_EXT_FLAG_NEEDS_CPU_ACCESS flag
+----------------------------------------------
+New gem_create_ext flag to tell the kernel that a BO will require CPU access.
+This becomes important when placing an object in I915_MEMORY_CLASS_DEVICE, where
+underneath the device has a small BAR, meaning only some portion of it is CPU
+accessible. Without this flag the kernel will assume that CPU access is not
+required, and prioritize using the non-CPU visible portion of
+I915_MEMORY_CLASS_DEVICE.
+
+.. kernel-doc:: Documentation/gpu/rfc/i915_small_bar.h
+   :functions: __drm_i915_gem_create_ext
+
+probed_cpu_visible_size attribute
+---------------------------------
+New struct__drm_i915_memory_region attribute which returns the total size of the
+CPU accessible portion, for the particular region. This should only be
+applicable for I915_MEMORY_CLASS_DEVICE. We also report the
+unallocated_cpu_visible_size, alongside the unallocated_size.
+
+Vulkan will need this as part of creating a separate VkMemoryHeap with the
+VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT set, to represent the CPU visible portion,
+where the total size of the heap needs to be known. It also wants to be able to
+give a rough estimate of how memory can potentially be allocated.
+
+.. kernel-doc:: Documentation/gpu/rfc/i915_small_bar.h
+   :functions: __drm_i915_memory_region_info
+
+Error Capture restrictions
+--------------------------
+With error capture we have two new restrictions:
+
+    1) Error capture is best effort on small BAR systems; if the pages are not
+    CPU accessible, at the time of capture, then the kernel is free to skip
+    trying to capture them.
+
+    2) On discrete we now reject error capture on recoverable contexts. In the
+    future the kernel may want to blit during error capture, when for example
+    something is not currently CPU accessible.
