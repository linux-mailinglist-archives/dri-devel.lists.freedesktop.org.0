A DRM driver can implement the same fbdev acceleration hooks as an fbdev driver.

(Most DRM drivers never bothered because the HW is more complex than traditional 2D accelerators, and can't safely be used under all circumstances where fbdev acceleration hooks could get called from. That's not an issue for a traditional 2D accelerator driver though)
