I just measured that with a scope on actual hardware .

reg_fixed_voltage_probe() is the code which turns the regulator OFF, 
specifically in the part gpiod_get_optional(...GPIOD_OUT_LOW);

Yes, that's well possible.

No, the driver must respect the unprepare delay, that is what is 
currently not happening. Trying to somehow work around that by adding 
random changes to DT is not going to fix the fact that panel-simple is 
not respecting its own internal built-in constraints.
