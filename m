I see that i2c_driver probe ti_sn65dsi86_probe() is called first
which calls ti_sn65dsi86_resume() and ti_sn65dsi86_enable_comms()
and after that auxiliary_driver probe ti_sn_bridge_probe() is called
where pdata->bridge.type is set.

As per the bindings, I see that we should have "no-hpd" property in
the device description for platforms with bad HPD or disconnected HPD.

Then we can read it in ti_sn65dsi86_probe() before resume call and use
it as a conditional instead.
Since I do not have any "bad HPD signal" board, I would need some
help validating this on such boards from Ernest.

Also, that would mean adding "no-hpd" to all the platforms using
sn65dsi86 for baseline first, even before the driver changes are in.
Because if driver changes go in first, this would enable HPD for all
the platforms. Whereas, the dts changes alone are harmless.
But still I am doubtful about dts changes getting in before driver
changes.
Considering this, please let me know the order of changes and I will
send out the patches accordingly.

Thanks,
Jayesh
