Ah. This is extremely helpful as I'm immediately able to confirm it's 
node_exporter trying to access the hwmon readings (I have a monitoring 
infra for all my devboxes). Every sufficiently spaced read from say 
temp1_input wakes up the GPU. Not many people have their boxes working 
like this I guess... but at least we could probably reduce the log spam 
a bit if it's not feasible to get GPU metrics while avoiding to resume 
it? (Currently it's 25 lines per resume, mostly SMU resume logs and ring 
info.)

And of course this is not a big deal, I can always work around it 
locally. Thanks for the hint again.
