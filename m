Yes, it happens on every suspend cycle here.

I didn't notice the issue initially as fbdev does not seem to be
affected, and I've been running with this patch applied to suppress the
resume errors since it was posted.

I would not be surprised if there are further issues here, but we can't
just leave things completely broken as they currently are.
