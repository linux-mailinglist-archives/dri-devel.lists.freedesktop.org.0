Hi again! It's been a while since the last time I sent this, there's
still a good bit of work to do here but I think there's more then enough
to start reviewing the design I have so far :) - especially since I'll
be presenting this work at XDC2024 this year.  This patch series
introduces a WIP set of bindings for KMS drivers written in rust, based
on top of the work of quite a number of people:

* Garry Guo's #[unique] macro for #[vtable]
  (used for getting consistent memory addresses for C vtables, which we
  need for Opaque* object types)
* Andreas Hindborg's hrtimer bindings
  For vblank emulation in rvkms. Note: the version of the patch series
  used here is slightly older then the one he last sent upstream, but
  API wise it's more or less identical, with some additions I need to
  upstream.
* My IRQ bindings for rust + SpinlockIrq type
* Misc. Lock additions from me that need to be cleaned up + upstreamed
* Asahi Lina and Mar√≠a Canal's platform driver bindings + resource
  management patches
  I need to clean these up quite a bit and work on upstreaming these
* Asahi Lina and Danilo Krummrich's DRM device bindings for rust
* Asahi Lina's gem shmem bindings
* Some misc. DRM fixes from me

All of these dependencies are either in the process of currently being
upstreamed, or are planned by me to be upstreamed.

Since this is still a WIP, I've done my best to mark all of the patches
where I think there's still work to be done - along with leaving TODOs
in various comments, and in the commit descriptions for each WIP patch.
Some general TODOs series-wide to keep in mind here:

* I don't have code examples in the documentation yet, consider rvkms to
  be that example for the time being
* This compiles with a lot of warnings. I will hopefully have these
  cleaned up soon, but didn't have the time to sort through all of them
  since some of them are leftover from various dependencies we have
* Most of the documentation has been typed up, but don't be surprised if
  you find a few formatting issues (feel free to point them out though!)
* I need to go through and add appropriate SPDX copyright notices
* I need to make sure these compile independently. I think they should,
  but it's been a while since I checked
* I've left some currently unused bindings out, including:
  * CRTC commit_data equivalents
  * "Ephemeral data" - e.g. data in Crtc, Plane, and Connector objects
    that is embedded within the main modeset objects themselves but can
    only be accessed during an atomic commit.
  * Misc. DRM helpers (currently just a drm_rect port to rust)
* I still need to make the device registration in rvkms static,
  currently we do device probing/creation in the legacy fashion.

Because of the pretty substantial number of dependencies this patch
series relies on, I currently have a tag for this on my freedesktop
branch:

https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/lyudess/linux/-/commits/rvkms-xdc2024-base

Additionally, you can see the rest of the work I've done so far
(including the patches I omitted for this series) here:

https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/lyudess/linux/-/commits/rvkms-wip

And finally, I do have these patches applied on a branch also available
on my gitlab:

https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/lyudess/linux/-/commits/rvkms-xdc2024

And of course - since the last time I sent out these patches, I've split
things up quite a bit to make it easier to go through.

Cheers!
