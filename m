Disclaimer that I wouldn't go system-wide but per device - so somewhere 
in sysfs rather than a modparam. That kind of a toggle would not sound 
problematic to me since it leaves the policy outside the kernel and 
allows people to tune to their liking.

One side question thought - does AMD benefit from larger than 2MiB 
contiguous blocks? IIUC the maximum PTE is 2MiB so maybe not? In which 
case it may make sense to add some TTM API letting drivers tell the pool 
allocator what is the maximum order to bother with. Larger than that may 
have diminishing benefit for the disproportionate pressure on the memory 
allocator and reclaim.
