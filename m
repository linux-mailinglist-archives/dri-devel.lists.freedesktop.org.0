This is based on the initial memory requirement for unsigned PD. This includes memory for shell loading on DSP
+ memory for static heap allocations(heap allocations are dynamic for Signed PD). This requirement tends to
around 5MB. I'll update thisÂ  also information in commit text. There will be some additional memory passed to
the PD which will get added to the PD heap.
