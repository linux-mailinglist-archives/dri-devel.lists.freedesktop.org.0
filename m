I see we could have a few options here, non exhaustive list (especially 
omitting some sub-options):

1)
DRM core implements fdinfo, which emits the common parts, calling into 
the driver to do the rest.

2)
DRM adds helpers for driver to emit common parts of fdinfo.

3)
DRM core establishes a "spec" defining the common fields, the optional 
ones, and formats.

I was trending towards 3) because it is most lightweight and feeling is 
there isn't that much value in extracting a tiny bit of commonality in 
code. Proof in the pudding is how short the fdinfo vfunc is in this patch.

Ideally yes, but I have a feeling the ways how amdgpu and i915 track 
things are so different so first lets learn more about that.

I would like to understand how admgpu tracks GPU time since I am not 
getting these fields yet.

1)
You suggest to have a timestamp because of different clock domains?

2)
With the interval option - you actually have a restarting counter? Do 
you keep that in the driver or get it from hw itself?
