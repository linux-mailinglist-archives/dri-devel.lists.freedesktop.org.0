As we discussed before, while this might be true for the vmwgfx driver, for other drivers this message indicates that either the GPU hung, or something else went wrong spectacularly. As such, I think we do want to see these messages by default for other drivers at least.

I suspect this just papers over the real issue even with vmwgfx though.
