This isn't a different mode of operation. You're breaking the design and
internal guarantees and validity the code relies on. And as a consequence you
have to disable the functions that are obviously broken by scattering it with
WARN_ON() calls.

And for the remaining code that is not disabled we'd have entirely new
requirements on the guarantees the caller must provide in terms of reference
counts.

This is as if I'd try to promote a car with a broken engine control unit and
would tell you "It's just in a different mode of operation, where driving isn't
supported, but you can still heat the cabin and power the radio with the
engine.", hoping that the broken engine control unit has no other side effects.

Sorry, as much as I'd like to help and unblock you, I don't buy it.
