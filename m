Making this optional is kind of problematic from a security standpoint (information leak, at least if the memory was previously used by a different process). See e.g. the discussion starting at https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/9189#note_1972986 .

AFAICT the approach I suggested there (Clear freed memory in the background, and make it available for allocation again only once the clear has finished) isn't really possible with gem_shmem in its current state though. There seems to be ongoing work to do something like that for __GFP_ZERO in general, maybe gem_shmem could take advantage of that when it lands. I'm afraid this series can't depend on that though.

FWIW, the amdgpu driver uses a single ioctl for VM map & unmap (plus two additional operations for partial residency). Maybe this would make sense for the PowerVR driver as well, in particular if it might support partial residency in the future.

(amdgpu also uses similar multiplexer ioctls for other things such as context create/destroy/...)

Just an idea, feel free to ignore.

Does user space really need to pass in the FIRST/LAST flags, can't the kernel driver determine this implicitly? What happens if user space sets these incorrectly?

Does this affect only compute from the same context, or also from other contexts?

(Similar question for DRM_PVR_SUBMIT_JOB_COMPUTE_CMD_PREVENT_ALL_OVERLAP)


P.S. I mostly just skimmed the other patches of the series, but my impression is that the patches and code are cleanly structured and well-documented.
