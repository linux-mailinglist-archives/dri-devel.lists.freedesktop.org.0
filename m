Yes, verbose is redundant, we will use drm_dbg() instead of verbose.Â  
thanks.

I am correcting.

Something you want fbdev driver, for example simple-framebuffer driver which
using the firmware passed fb (screeninfo).

besides, text mode support.

The right decision for ls7a1000 is to use VRAM based helper, But sometimes
we need CMA helper based solution. Because: The PRIME support is lost, use
lsdc with etnaviv is not possible any more.

  Buffer sharing with etnaviv is no longer possible, loongson display controllers
  are simple which require scanout buffers to be physically contiguous.

  We still need to develop userspace driver(say xf86-video-loongson)
  on ls3a4000 + ls7a1000 platform then deploy those driver to ls2k1000 platform.

  ls3a4000 and ls3a5000 is fast enough which can build the linux kernel directly.
  Build mesa, libdrm, xf86-video-loongson just a piece of cake.

  Is is so fast on ls3a5000+ls7a1000, developing driver on ls2k1000 is cumbersome,
  embarrassing slow.

  I means it(ls3a4000/ls3a5000 + ls7a1000) is not just target for end user, but
  it is a platform which can be used to develop software for other platform.

  The author of linux device driver told us that device driver is providing mechanism, not policy.

  We are able to make the decision, but we want to give the user more choice.

  "pick the right decision all the time" is also true, i am considering correct this,
  thanks.
