If rcu lock is allowed to be dropped while walking the list what 
guarantees list of fences hasn't been freed?

Like:

1st call
   -> gets seqcount
   -> stores cursor->fences

rcu lock dropped/re-acquired

2nd call
   -> dereferences into cursor->fences -> boom?

Is_first is useful to callers - like they are legitimately allowed to 
look inside this, what could otherwise be private object? What is the 
intended use case, given when true the returned fence can be either 
exclusive or first from a shared list?

Is_exclusive could be written as index == -1 in the code, right? If so 
then an opportunity to remove some redundancy.

Has the fact RCU lock can be dropped so there is potential to walk over 
completely different snapshots been discussed?

At least if I followed the code correctly - it appears there is 
potential the walk restarts from the start (exclusive slot) at any point 
during the walk.

Because theoretically I think you could take an atomic snapshot of 
everything (given you have a cursor object) and then release it on the 
end condition.
