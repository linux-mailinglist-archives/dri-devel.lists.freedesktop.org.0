The drm_gpuva_ops are usually used in a pattern like this.

	vm_bind {
		for_each_vm_bind_operation {
			drm_gpuva_for_each_op {
				// modify drm_gpuvm's interval tree
				// pre-allocate memory
				// lock and prepare objects
			}
		}
		
		drm_sched_entity_push_job();
	}

	run_job {
		for_each_vm_bind_operation {
			drm_gpuva_for_each_op {
				// modify page tables
			}
		}
	}

	run_job {
		for_each_vm_bind_operation {
			drm_gpuva_for_each_op {
				// free page table structures, if any
				// free unused pre-allocated memory
			}
		}
	}

What did you do instead to get map/unmap overlapping? Even more interesting,
what are you doing now?

But vm_op_enqueue() creates exactly this list of operations you would get from
drm_gpuvm_sm_{map,unmap}_ops_create(), just manually, no?

Yeah, it's probably fine, since, as you say, the only additional object can be
the req_obj from the previous iteration.
