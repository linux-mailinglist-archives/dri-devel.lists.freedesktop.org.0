Yes, this is the only one missing.

That is correct.

In my opinion, the support for building the Linux kernel on macOS is primarily
supported by LLVM/Clang and the Linux kernel build system. The merged patches
were merely minor tweaks such this one (and refactors from Masahiro), intended
to enable users to configure the build system on these platforms. Patches
dropped led to the creation of the bee-headers project, which allows users
customize their build setup, which seems to be a common practice when people
requires to tweak the build environment.

Thanks!

With this, we can now build arm64 in macOS defconfig, allyesconfig and
allmodconfig targets even with Rust support!
