From: John Harrison <John.C.Harrison@Intel.com>

Some testing environments and some heavier tests are slower than
previous limits allowed for. For example, it can take multiple seconds
for the 'context has been reset' notification handler to reach the
'kill the requests' code in the 'active' version of the 'reset
engines' test. During which time the selftest gets bored, gives up
waiting and fails the test.

There is also an async thread that the selftest uses to pump work
through the hardware in parallel to the context that is marked for
reset. That also could get bored waiting for completions and kill the
test off.

Lastly, the flush at the of various test sections can also see
timeouts due to the large amount of work backed up. This is also true
of the live_hwsp_read test.
