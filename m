Except my commit does *not* gate SoC power, nor SoC clocks ðŸ™‚

What the "Really power off ..." commit does is to ask the GPU to internally power
off the shaders, tilers and L2, that's why I say that it is strange to see that
kind of abort.

The GPU_INT_CLEAR GPU_INT_STAT, GPU_FAULT_STATUS and GPU_FAULT_ADDRESS_{HI/LO}
registers should still be accessible even with shaders, tilers and cache OFF.

Anyway, yes, synchronizing IRQs before calling the poweroff sequence would also
work, but that'd add up quite a bit of latency on the runtime_suspend() call, so
in this case I'd be more for avoiding to execute any register r/w in the handler
by either checking if the GPU is supposed to be OFF, or clearing interrupts, which
may not work if those are generated after the execution of the poweroff function.
Or we could simply disable the irq after power_off, but that'd be hacky (as well).


Let's see if asking to poweroff *everything* works:
