It could work like that yes.

I only wonder if it would creating too much of the usual DRM mess of 
common helpers and vfuncs, and vfuncs implemented via common helpers, 
which call vfuncs, implemented by common helpers.. mental stack overflow.

I also need to go back to one of the early threads on fdinfo to remind 
myself what was my counter proposal to the current design. In case it 
would be more clearly more elegant at this point.

But anyway, first the core question of whether we really need the 
internal separated out.

Xe and amddgpu too, at least. So I guess the general principle when 
proposing extensions is to have a browse around all current users.

Skipping the print maybe yeah. Or even better a supported status flag as 
is for resident and purgeable. But first the discussion on justifying 
internal as a separate thing.

I agree internal allocations should generally be accounted. Question is 
does it need to be separately.
