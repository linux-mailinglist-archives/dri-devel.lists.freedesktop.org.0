That's a good question, I can't remember the reason now, but I guess the
reasoning in something like: most MIPI DBI compatible controllers I've
seen is spec'ed at max 10MHz write speed and 2MHz read speed. I suppose
I have tried to match that read is slower than write. So I have probably
tried to play safe here. Not dividing by 2 is also fine by me.
The reason for allowing max_speed out of spec is that most controllers
can receive pixel data way above the nominal speed, often 4-6x, with the
occasional pixel glitch. We can't allow commands to glitch so must run
at nominal speed. mipi_dbi_spi_cmd_max_speed() is the one that caps the
write speed.

I have checked and the code lines up with Figure 26 Type C Interface
Read Sequence â€“ Option 1 in the MIPI DBI v2.0 standard.
