Okay, I now understand what you are saying. Indeed, I was mapping the
DSS VP and DT DSS port as 1:1 in my mind, which should not be the case.

Right. There has to be 2 ports for OLDI in DSS, to be connected to 2
ports of a single panel (dual link) or 2 ports of 2 panels (cloning).

Yeah, they are indeed on the sink side. I was misunderstood about this.
And the onus for properties is not on DSS nodes anymore.

This probably is a different discussion, but since the sink is now
responsible for those properties, these should get introduced in the
panel-common bindings, right?

The above example has a separate binding, but many dumb dual-link panels
will require those properties in panel-common.

Agreed.

Moreover, I will update the binding to reflect 3 ports for am625-dss.
