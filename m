Hi Christian,

going to reply in more detail when I have some more time, so just some
quick thoughts for now.

With bracketed access you could even make this case work, as the dGPU
would be able to slurp a copy of the dma-buf into LMEM for scanout.

It the normal case for a lot of ARM SoCs. That world is certainly not
any less big than the x86 dGPU world. A huge number of devices are ARM
based set-top boxes and other video players. Just because it is a
special case for you doesn't mean it's a global special case.

And on a lot of ARM SoCs it's exactly the right thing to do. Many
codecs need contiguous memory there, so importing a scatter-gather
buffer from the GPU via dma-buf will simply not work.

By mandating a software fallback for the cases where you would need
bracketed access to the dma-buf, you simply shift the problem into
userspace. Userspace then creates the bracket by falling back to some
other import option that mostly do a copy and then the appropriate
cache maintenance.

While I understand your sentiment about the DMA-API design being
inconvenient when things are just coherent by system design, the DMA-
API design wasn't done this way due to bad engineering, but due to the
fact that performant DMA access on some systems just require this kind
of bracketing.

Lucas
