I've fixed this in a second version of the patch and now calculate the maximum
operating frequency during the driver initialisation stage in the following way:

unsigned long freq = ULONG_MAX;

/* Find the fastest defined rate  */
opp = dev_pm_opp_find_freq_floor(dev, &freq);
if (IS_ERR(opp))
	return PTR_ERR(opp);
pfdev->features.fast_rate = freq;

dev_pm_opp_put(opp);

Regarding the number of cycles, sampling CYCLE_COUNT would give us the most
accurate figure, however fdinfo must return values that are relative to the file
being queried, whereas that register would give us a raw count for all queues.

There's also the problem of clock frequencies being variable over time because
of DVFS. To get an accurate value for the number of cycles spent in a given
job, we would have to store clock frequencies together with their timestamps
every time there's a rate change, and then in the job deque function traverse
it, find the interval intersection and multiply every frequency by its
respective length. This sounds like too much work, so I think until I can come
up with something less complex I'm going to drop reporting of the drm-cycles
value altogether.

Although come think of it, maybe I could sample the number of cycles both at
the beginning and end of a job and add that to an overall per-file tally.

Thanks for pointing this out, I hadn't thought about that the same file could
have two simultaneous jobs running at the same time.

I've checked what other drivers do for reporting these values, and they print a
separate drm-engine value for each of their execution units (render, copy,
compute, etc).  In our case, because there are 2 or 3 queues, perhaps we should
do the same.
