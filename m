I feel like I forgot to mention this earlier because I can't find a 
reference to it in my mails.  I would like to see something in 
Documentation for this driver/device.  Would be nice to get an overview 
of how it works (system block diagram?), how it is intended to be used, 
etc.  Include relevant references.  This would be a great place to 
document the UMD and the compiler (I am positive you have mentioned the 
compiler before, but I am currently failing to find a reference to it).

I feel that traditional DRM gets away from not needing this since their 
stuff is pretty well established.  Everyone uses Mesa/igt and so how 
things are structured/used is fairly well implied.  Accel is brand new 
and doesn't have that yet so I suspect we'll be well situated if we take 
the extra effort to spell out these things which might be just assumed 
elsewhere.  Hopefully, over time, such documentation helps in 
identifying useful areas to build up the common code of the subsystem.

I can't justify holding up this series for this though.  Please put it 
on some todo list  :)

-Jeff
