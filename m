Well as far as I can see this really breaks uAPI, we have unit tests 
exercising this.

But see more on this below.

Yeah, but to make my point clear once more: I can't allow any patch in 
which would change amdgpus existing uAPI behavior.

What we can talk about is changing the behavior by adding flags to the 
fpriv to change the behavior and/or stuff the CS fence by default into 
the exclusive slot.

For the later I think we could do something like using a dma_fence_chain 
for the exclusive fence in amdgpu. This way we would have the same 
semantics in the CS and still support the epoll and Jasons new import IOCTL.

But the semantics of the amdgpu CS interface to not serialize from the 
same process and always serialize if you see some different process must 
stay the same or otherwise I have quite a bunch of angry end users.

No, that is correct behavior. This was added intentionally and we have 
an use cases which rely on this.

The concept is that when two processes access the same buffer object 
they should serialize, no matter what.

You can opt-out of that by setting the EXPLICIT_SYNC flag on the BO.

Yeah, I'm also wondering how we can ever merge the two approaches back 
together. I'm not sure that this is possible.

Well do you mean the other way around? E.g. that you can *not* ignore 
the exclusive fence when shared once are present?

As far as I know nouveau is the only driver left using that (maybe i915 
somewhere, but not sure) and it would really help if we could remove that.

Yeah, I know. Basically everybody which adds more than a CS fence to the 
shared slots will ignore this.

As said above if we drop this (which would be great) at least nouveau 
would need to be fixed.

See amdgpu_gem_object_close():

...
 Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  fence = dma_resv_get_excl(bo->tbo.base.resv);
 Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  if (fence) {
 Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  amdgpu_bo_fence(bo, fence, true);
 Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  fence = NULL;
 Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  }
...

We explicitly added that because resource management of some other 
driver was going totally bananas without that.

But I'm not sure which one that was. Maybe dig a bit in the git and 
mailing history of that.

Unbound like in not waiting for the exclusive fence.

Dito. I mean I didn't came up with the approach for amdgpu out of 
nowhere, but rather because we had some specific use cases for that.

Back in the R6xx days some guys where putting a semaphore at the end of 
each BO and serialized engine access to the BO using that. E.g. see how 
radeon works internally with the semaphore block.

This is basically the same concept implemented with the dma_resv object 
instead.

Yeah, indeed.
