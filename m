--- Comment #8 from Andrew Sheldon <asheldon55@gmail.com> ---
I just did some more tests, and in my case, it wasn't strictly the refresh
rate, but the timings being too aggressive (which I needed to do to lower t=
he
pixel clock enough due to driver limits, which are quite conservative).

This wasn't as much of a problem with Vega, since the idle power usage was
about the same (12-15W), but it is with Navi.

I will also add that during my tests, I found it was possible to leave the
system in a state where I couldn't leave the high memclock/power usage
situation after a while, even when switching to 60hz, requiring a reboot. So
that might be what is happening on your system, Robert.
