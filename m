--- Comment #13 from Marco (rodomar705@protonmail.com) ---
The only way I had it "fixed" (it's more of a workaround, but it is working) is
to slightly drop the clocks (my GPU has by default a max boost clock of 1430
MHz, I have dropped it to 1340 MHz) and voltages (From 1150 mV to 1040 mV on
peak clocks, however both depends on your specific silicon, this is just my
values). 

Now, if the system post after the downclock of it (sometimes lowering
clocks/voltages triggers a black screen bug at boot when the values are applied
with systemd, not sure if the issue is the same), however, if I can reach the
login screen, the system will work perfectly fine under load with no problem.
Never had a crash while using since.

I do not know if it's a specific issue of my silicon, since after this issue
happened to my card the same applies under Windows system. Repasting didn't
help.
