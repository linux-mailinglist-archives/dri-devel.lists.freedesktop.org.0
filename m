That really should have happened before submitting this patch. It was luck that I happened to notice it fly by.

The primary symptom (which affected myself as a user as well, that was the motivation for addressing it) was that mutter fell back to SW cursor, because the legacy KMS cursor ioctl returned an error. There were corresponding messages from mutter, visible e.g. in the journal.

That the HW cursor remained visible for some users was a secondary symptom, probably due to a separate bug. I don't remember ever hitting that myself.

Note that current versions of mutter use atomic KMS and probably don't hit this issue anymore by default. You'd need to set the environment variable MUTTER_DEBUG_ENABLE_ATOMIC_KMS=0 or use an older version of mutter.

> It is not evident to me why we cannot reproduce this problem. Do you have some suggestions? If we find a case showing this bug, we can add it as part of our tests.

Something like this should work:

1. Call drmModeRmFB for the FB currently assigned to the primary plane. This implicitly disables the primary plane.
2. Call drmModeSetCursor(2) with a non-0 BO handle and position & dimensions such that the cursor would be visible on the CRTC.

Before b836a274b797, this resulted in drmModeSetCursor(2) returning EINVAL due to

	if (state->enable && state->active &&
	    does_crtc_have_active_cursor(state) &&
	    dm_crtc_state->active_planes == 0)
		return -EINVAL;


(The b836a274b797 commit log describes a similar error when trying to flip the legacy DPMS property from off to on. My memory is hazy on this, but I guess that would have prevented the monitor from turning back on after DPMS off if the primary/cursor planes happened to be disable/enabled respectively when trying to toggle the property)

A Wayland compositor or other user space may legitimately try to display something (not necessarily a "cursor") using only the cursor plane. The driver must accurately signal that this cannot work. The established way to do so (if a bit indirectly) is to require the primary plane to be enabled whenever the CRTC is.

This is getting a bit silly.

Why are you guys trying to marginalize the scenarios I'm explaining? So you don't need to modify the IGT tests? Or what is the goal?

IGT tests aren't some kind of holy water; they can have bugs. In which case the proper course of action is to fix them, not to work around them in the kernel.

If atomic user space asks "please enable the CRTC and one plane", the kernel responds "sure, no problem", but that one plane isn't actually visible as a result, that is never OK. That is why this patch is not acceptable.

I don't have time for this ATM. Feel free to pick it up.
