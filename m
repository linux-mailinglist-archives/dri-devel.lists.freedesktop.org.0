... this one are all that are actually needed - the rest should be
ignored as they affect cores that aren't present.

The Exynos 5422 SoC has a T628 MP6 - so two core groups which isn't a
particularly well supported configuration. But I'm not sure how we're
ending up with the second core group being powered up in the first
place. Even if it was left powered by something previous (e.g. the
bootloader) then the soft-reset during probe should cause them to power
down.

But it seems like a good idea to power off everything when powering
down, even if we didn't expect the cores to be on.

Boris also has a point that before cutting the power/clocks we should
really be synchronising with the IRQs - but that affects the follow on
patches not this one.
