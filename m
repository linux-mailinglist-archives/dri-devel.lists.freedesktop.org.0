Even before this change I couldn't get the panel to reliably work without keeping 
the regulator always on (just to point out that I'm not introducing regressions).

I am already trying to understand why this happens... and I'm still researching...
but there's what I've seen for now:
  * Set the panel regulator as regulator-boot-on;
  * Boot: edp-panel will correctly read the EDID, then will run the PM suspend
    handler
  * mtk-dp's .get_edid() callback gets called but, at that time, edp-panel will
    still be suspended (PM resume handler didn't get called)
    * Regulator is still down
  * Failure.

That's not right and probably the .get_edid() callback in mtk-dp has an abuse:
there, mtk_dp_parse_capabilities() gets called, which performs initialization
of some variables for DP link training (essential to get the DP going!).

The question that I am making to myself is whether I should move that elsewhere,
if so, what's the right place (making me able to remove the DRM_BRIDGE_OP_EDID
bridge flag when eDP + aux-bus), or if I should leave that and make sure that the
panel-edp's resume callback is called before .get_edid() from mtk-dp gets called.

That can get done in a separated series (or single patch?)... so that if we get
this one picked sooner than later, we can start upstreaming the panel nodes in
the Cherry devicetrees and only remove the regulator-always-on later.

Thoughts?

Cheers,
Angelo
