This function post removal of the caching stuff was doing 3 jobs,
moving non system old ttm to system, moving from system to a new TT
and assigning. Instead this series splits it into 3 and only calls
the necessary combination from the drivers.

This is just a cleaned up and rebased version of some patches I've posted
before, and should be easier to digest. (Ben's r-bs are probably enough
to land this, but I said I'd resend first).

Thanks,
Dave.
