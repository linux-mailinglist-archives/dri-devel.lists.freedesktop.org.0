While I think it can still have some effect when there's a single work item for multiple rings, as described by James, it's probably negligible, since presumably the time intervals between ring_begin_use and ring_end_use are normally much shorter than a second.

Yeah, I think that would be much better.

Agreed, just wanted to note that this is most likely not the right 
solution since Alex was already picking it up.

Going to reply separately on the new patch as well.
