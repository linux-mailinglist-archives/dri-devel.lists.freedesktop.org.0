That's the device yes. For the user the screen is landscape, but the 
actual panel is 800x1280 portrait. Left edge is top of the display. 
(Hence the pre-existing entry in drm_get_panel_orientation_quirk.)

You mean declare it a firmware bug and live with the corrupt console 
until the final fb driver takes over?
