Keeping a reference alive via hpd_enable() fixes the issue.
Things works with the previous detect logic and I do not need to
rely on reading link status.


In hpd_enable()/disable(), I do not need to add anything else:

+static void ti_sn_bridge_hpd_enable(struct drm_bridge *bridge)
+{
+       struct ti_sn65dsi86 *pdata = bridge_to_ti_sn65dsi86(bridge);
+       pm_runtime_get_sync(pdata->dev);
+}
+
+static void ti_sn_bridge_hpd_disable(struct drm_bridge *bridge)
+{
+       struct ti_sn65dsi86 *pdata = bridge_to_ti_sn65dsi86(bridge);
+       pm_runtime_put_sync(pdata->dev);
+}
+

Posting v3 with these changes.

Warm Regards,
Jayesh
