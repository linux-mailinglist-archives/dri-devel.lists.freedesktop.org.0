Yes patch 6 makes the change because kmap_atomic() was no longer declared in
asm/highmem.h.  I'm pretty sure 0-day caught that ...  but I seem to remember
noticing some oddness in that file and I did go through it by hand.

Easy enough. Added as a follow on patch.

Agreed.  Done in a follow on patch.

Grepping for 'asm/highmem.h' and investigations don't reveal any issues...  But
you do have me worried.  That said 0-day has been crunching on multiple
versions of this series without issues such as this (save the mips issue
above).

I have to say it would be nice if the relation between linux/highmem.h and
asm/highmem.h was more straightforward.
