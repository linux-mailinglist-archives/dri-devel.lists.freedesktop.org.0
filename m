--- Comment #7 from Duncan (1i5t5.duncan@cox.net) ---
Bisecting, but it's slow going when the bug can take 12+ hours to trigger, and
even then I can't be sure a "good" is actually so.

So far (at 5.6.0-01623-g12ab316ce, ~7 bisect steps to go, under 100 commits
"after"), the first few were all "good", while the one I'm currently testing
obviously isn't "bad" in terms of this bug yet, but does display a nasty
buffer-sync issue with off-frame read-outs and eventual firefox crashes trying
to play 4k@30fps youtube in firefox, a bit of a struggle with this kit but
usually OK (it's the 4k@60fps that's the real problem in firefox/chromium, tho
it tends to be fine without the browser overhead in mpv/smplayer/vlc).

But I hadn't seen that issue with the full 5.7-rc1 thru rc3, so it was
apparently already fixed with rc1.  And no incidents of this bug, full system
or full graphics lockups with a segfault in amdgpu_dm_atomic_commit_tail,
during the bisect yet.
