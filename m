I can probably find something else to try later.

On a new/broken kernel, every time I run "reboot" the video turns off
when Linux does whatever it does to make the system restart.

The video comes on again if I manage to boot it up again.

The problem is that I have to do that without using the screen.  So I
can boot Linux via the serial port, or via the BMC web interface, or
by just typing on the keyboard without seeing what is happening.

Unplugging/replugging the cable when the video is off after rebooting
does not cause it to start working again.

I have certainly never noticed any problem related to hot plugging while
the video output is working but this is not something I ever normally
do.  I can try it later.

There is never any problem with the video output if I fully power off/on
the system.  The problem only occurs on a reboot.

Again there is never any problem if I fully power off/on the system.

Thanks,
