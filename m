From: Tvrtko Ursulin <tvrtko.ursulin@igalia.com>

When we had to quickly deal with a tree build issue via merging
792d16b5375d ("drm/v3d: Move perfmon init completely into own unit"), we
promised to follow up with a nicer solution.

As in the process of eliminating the hardcoded defines we have discovered a few
issues in handling of corner cases and userspace input validation, the fix has
turned into a larger series, but hopefully the end result is a justifiable
cleanup.

v2:
 * Re-order the patches so fixes come first while last three are optional
   cleanups.

v3:
 * Fixed a bunch of rebase errors I made when re-ordering patches from v1 to v2.
 * Dropped the double underscore from __v3d_timestamp_query_info_free.
 * Added v3d prefix to v3d_copy_query_info.
 * Renamed qinfo to query_info.
 * Fixed some spelling errors and bad patch references.
 * Added mention to get_user to one commit message.
 * Dropped one patch from the series which became redundant due other
   re-ordering.
 * Re-ordered last two patches with the view of dropping the last.
