There is also W=e, added by commit c77d06e70d59 ("kbuild: support W=e
to make build abort in case of warning") in 5.19, which works well for
building with configurations that do not have CONFIG_WERROR enabled and
avoiding dipping into menuconfig.

Unconditionally enabling -Werror with no way to turn it off is just
asking for problems over time with new compiler versions, either due to
new warnings in -Wall or warnings that have been improved or changed.
Should that still be desired, consider doing what i915 and PowerPC have
done and add a Kconfig option that can be disabled.

Cheers,
Nathan
