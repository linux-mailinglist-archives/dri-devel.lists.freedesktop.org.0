Thinking about it, maybe it's not to bad that it only changes once udev is 
ready, like this udev could decide if leds should be used or if it should 
directly be passed to OpenRGB for example, giving at least some consistency only 
changing once: i.e. firmware -> OpenRGB setting and not firmware->leds 
setting->OpenRGB setting.

I don't really see this point: The LampArray API is defined by the HID Usage 
Table and the report descriptor, so there is not API to mess up and everything 
else has to be parsed dynamically by userspace anyway, so it can easily be 
changed and userspace just adopts automatically.

And for this case the proper HID driver is already ready.

So the only point for me currently is: Is it ok to have key position/usage 
description tables in the kernel driver or not?
