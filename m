Reading the thread makes me wonder whether we should be going into
slightly other direction:

Add __must_check() to mipi_dsi_ writing functions,

#define mipi_dsi_dcs_whatever_write(dsi, cmd, seq...)	\
	({						\
		static const u8 d[] = { cmd, seq };     \
                mipi_dsi_dcs_write_buffer(dsi, d, ARRAY_SIZE(d));    \
	})

Then in panel drivers we actually have to explicitly handle the return
code (either by dropping to the error label or by just returning an
error).

Do we really care, which command has failed? I mean, usually either all
DSI transfers work, or we have an issue with the DSI host.
