Would this bit be better left out from core implementation, given how 
the approach is the component which implements dma-fence has to track 
the actual deadline and all?

Also taking a step back - are we all okay with starting to expand the 
relatively simple core synchronisation primitive with side channel data 
like this? What would be the criteria for what side channel data would 
be acceptable? Taking note the thing lives outside drivers/gpu/.
