Well I now agree that the rules around dma_resv are different than I 
thought, but this change should have raised more eyebrows.

The problem is this completely broke interop with all drivers using TTM 
and I think might even explain some bug reports.

I re-introduced the moving fence by adding bo->moving a few years after 
the initial introduction of dma_resv, but that was just to work around 
performance problems introduced by using the exclusive fence for both 
use cases.

I'm not 100% sure, but I think before the switch to the dma_resv object 
drivers just waited for the BOs to become idle and that should have 
prevented this.

Anyway let's stop discussing history and move forward. Sending patches 
for all affected TTM driver with CC: stable tags in a minute.

Please give that some priority.

Ignoring the moving fence is a information leak, but messing up the DAG 
gives you access to freed up memory.

Oh! That might actually explain some issues, but that just completely 
breaks when TTM based drivers use atomic.

In other words for the first use is actually rather likely for TTM based 
drivers to need to move the buffer around so that scanout is possible.

And that in turn means you need to wait for this move to finish even if 
you have an explicit fence to wait for. IIRC amdgpu rolled its own 
implementation of this and radeon doesn't have atomic, but nouveau is 
most like broken.

So we do need a better solution for this sooner or later.

Well it's probably rather Dave or Linus who might start to throw chairs 
at us to not getting this straight sooner.

At least the weather is getting more durable.
