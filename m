Gallium/Panfrost changes to make use of this new user submission API can 
now be found here:
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/ketil.johnsen/mesa/-/commits/panthor_usersubmit/?ref_type=heads

It is worth repeating, this is just a dumb switch from kernel submission 
to user submission for the Panfrost Gallium driver, no optimizations 
attempted. We have no concrete plans to pursue upstreaming of this for 
the time being. Panvk is our focus in that regard.
