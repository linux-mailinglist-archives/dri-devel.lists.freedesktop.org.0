dmesg from 5.7.0.994 boot attempt

Applies to a 2015 5k iMac 27" with AMD r9390x video card. I was asked to file
this as I have been testing 5.3, 5.4, 5.6 and 5.7 kernel, all of which boot
very slowly (> 3 minutes to working desktop), and also have delayed wakeup from
display sleep (~2 minutes) and delayed shutdown (~ 2 minutes). dmesg and
systemd analysis for these boots have been posted in
bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1875211.

I have been asked to test several of the 5.7 rc kernels and the latest version
(5.7.0.994). Only one of these versions would boot at all (rc3); the other rc
kernels would only get as far as the login screen, and 5.7.0.994 wouldn't get
even that far. Attached is the dmesg to the 5.7.0.994 boot attempt.
