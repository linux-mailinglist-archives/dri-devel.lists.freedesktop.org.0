correct, only the vma is rounded up

The kernel has to handle 4K pages also, which could in theory attempt to 
be placed in any remaining space within a 2MB region, which is not 
supported. For this reason, the kernel rounds up the vma to next 2MB to 
ensure no 4K pages can treat the remaining space as a candidate for 
placement.

For mesa, this is not required as they only ever use 2MB alignment for 
all buffers, hence the denial of the mesa mr.

Internally, the kernel will still round up the vma reservations to 
prevent any kernel 4K buffers being situated in remaining space.

If desired, we can make the wording clearer, maybe something like:

"To keep things simple for userland, we mandate that any GTT mappings
must be aligned to 2MB. The kernel will internally pad them out to the 
next 2MB boundary"
