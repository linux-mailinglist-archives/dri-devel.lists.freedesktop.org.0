What about this question? For discrete userspace will assume WC and will 
know how to flush WC buffer? Or it is assumed the flush will be hit 
implicitly? Will this be documented?

Why probe and not populate? For me probe is weak and implies to give a 
guarantee which cannot really be given. If the pointer is not trusted, 
there is no reason to think it cannot go bad between creating the buffer 
(probe) and actual use. Populate on the other hand could be described as 
simply instantiate the backing store with the same caveat mentioned. No 
guarantees about the future validity of the backing store in either case 
should be implied.

I am not up to speed to understand how to PCI ids come into play here, 
but what is the suggestion with the dummy batch - to actually submit 
something which ends up executing, waking up the GPU etc? Or be crafty 
and make it fail after it acquires backing store? Not sure if we have 
such a spot that late so just asking to start with. If the plan is to 
wake up the GPU that's quite ugly in my opinion. Especially since patch 
which adds the flag already exists so shouldn't really be much a delay 
to sync userspace and i915 merge.

I didn't get what the UMDs have allowed?
