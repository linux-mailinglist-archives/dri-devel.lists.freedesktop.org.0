The commit message mentions "Update timedout_job()'s documentation". As
this hunk is related to `run_job()`, maybe it would be a better fit to
patch 2/3.

I believe that a mention to `drm_sched_resubmit_jobs()` still worth it,
even mentioning that it is a deprecated option and it shouldn't be used
in new code. It is deprecated indeed, but we still have five users.
