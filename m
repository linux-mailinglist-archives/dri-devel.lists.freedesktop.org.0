--- Comment #48 from muncrief (rmuncrief@humanavance.com) ---
I have an R9-390 that just started having the resume from suspend problem as of
5.5-rc1. And I just tested 5.5-rc2 and the problem persists.

The problem looks exactly the same as the one that plagued the R9-390 starting
with the 4.20 kernel, but was fixed a few releases later.

My system goes into suspend mode normally, but when resuming my monitor says
"Signal not recognized" and I have to SSH into my system and reboot it.

I'm running Manjaro with Mesa 19.2.7 amdgpu, and the last working kernel is
5.4.2. So something in the new 5.5 amdgpu has borked the R9-390 again.
