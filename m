Sorry, but I did not think that the discussion above was directly related.  If
I'm not mistaken, Thomas' work was directed at relaxing kmap_atomic() into
kmap_thread() calls.  While interesting, it is not the point of this series.  I
want to restrict kmap() callers into kmap_thread().

For this series it was considered to change the kmap_thread() call sites to
kmap_atomic().  But like I said in the cover letter kmap_atomic() is not the
same semantic.  It is too strict.  Perhaps I should have expanded that
explanation.

I don't understand.  You mean there would be other call sites calling:

kmap_atomic()
memcpy()
kunmap_atomic()

?

The reason for the new call is that with PKS added behind kmap we have 3 levels
of mapping we want.

global kmap (can span threads and sleep)
'thread' kmap (can sleep but not span threads)
'atomic' kmap (can't sleep nor span threads [by definition])

As Matthew said perhaps 'global kmaps' may be best changed to vmaps?  I just
don't know the details of every call site.

And since I don't know the call site details if there are kmap_thread() calls
which are better off as kmap_atomic() calls I think it is worth converting
them.  But I made the assumption that kmap users would already be calling
kmap_atomic() if they could (because it is more efficient).
