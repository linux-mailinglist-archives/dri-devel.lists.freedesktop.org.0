Maybe in msm you could reserve 0 for kernel submissions (if you have 
such use cases) and expose levels 1-3 via drm/sched? If you could wire 
that up, and if four levels is most your hardware will have.

Although with that option it seems drm/sched could starve lower 
priorities, I mean not give anything to the hw/fw scheduler on higher 
rings as longs as there is work on lower. Which if those chips have some 
smarter algorithm would defeat it.

So perhaps there is no way but improving drm/sched. Backend controlled 
number of priorities and backend control for whether "in flight" job s 
limit is global vs per priority level (per run queue).

Btw my motivation looking into all this is that we have CPU nice and 
ionice supporting more levels and I'd like to tie that all together into 
one consistent user friendly story (see 
https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/series/102348/). In a world of 
heterogenous compute pipelines I think that is the way forward. I even 
demonstrated this from within ChromeOS, since the compositor uses nice 
-5 is automatically gives it more GPU bandwith compared to for instance 
Android VM.

I know of other hardware supporting more than three levels, but I need 
to study more drm drivers to gain a complete picture. I only started 
with msm since it looked simple. :)

What kind of scheduling algorithm does your hardware have between those 
priority levels?

Not sure about the value there - as mentioned before I see problems on 
the uapi front with not all priorities being equal.

Besides, priority order scheduling is kind of meh to me. Especially if 
it only applies in the scheduling frontend. If frontend and backend 
algorithms do not even match then it's even more weird.

IMO sooner or later GPU scheduling will have to catchup with state of 
the art from the CPU world and use priority as a hint for time sharing 
decisions.

We don't use drm/sched yet, I was just mentioning what we have in uapi. 
But yes, our current scheduling backend can handle more than three levels.

> But is there anything that actually *uses* that many levels of priority?

 From userspace no, there are only a few internal priority levels for 
things like heartbeats the driver is sending to check engine health and 
page flip priority boosts.
