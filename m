To me it would seem better for the driver to return an error if the async flag is passed in, but the driver can't actually do an async update.

Otherwise it's tricky for a Wayland compositor to decide if it should use an async commit (which needs to be done ASAP to serve the intended purpose) or not (in which case the compositor may want to delay the commit as long as possible for minimal latency).
