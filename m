I think we can combine Ingo's with the reply I used and you adopted and
continue to have it when sending the update messages, probably keep it
in the cover letter (the combined text) and add a link to each
individual update:

"Please see tools/include/README.kernel-copies."

The recommendation that developers shouldn't update the copy seems
important to have there as well.
