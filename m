Hi,

This patch set allocates the protected DMA-bufs from a DMA-heap
instantiated from the TEE subsystem.

The TEE subsystem handles the DMA-buf allocations since it is the TEE
(OP-TEE, AMD-TEE, TS-TEE, or perhaps a future QTEE) which sets up the
protection for the memory used for the DMA-bufs.

The DMA-heap uses a protected memory pool provided by the backend TEE
driver, allowing it to choose how to allocate the protected physical
memory.

The allocated DMA-bufs must be imported with a new TEE_IOC_SHM_REGISTER_FD
before they can be passed as arguments when requesting services from the
secure world.

Three use-cases (Secure Video Playback, Trusted UI, and Secure Video
Recording) have been identified so far to serve as examples of what can be
expected. The use-cases have predefined DMA-heap names,
"protected,secure-video", "protected,trusted-ui", and
"protected,secure-video-record". The backend driver registers protected
memory pools for the use-cases it supports.

Each use-case has its own protected memory pool since different use-cases
require isolation from different parts of the system. A protected memory
pool can be based on a static carveout instantiated while probing the TEE
backend driver, or dynamically allocated from CMA (dma_alloc_pages()) and
made protected as needed by the TEE.

This can be tested on a RockPi 4B+ with the following steps:
repo init -u https://github.com/jenswi-linaro/manifest.git -m rockpi4.xml \
        -b prototype/sdp-v12
repo sync -j8
cd build
make toolchains -j$(nproc)
make all -j$(nproc)
# Copy ../out/rockpi4.img to an SD card and boot the RockPi from that
# Connect a monitor to the RockPi
# login and at the prompt:
gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc ! \
        aesenc key=1f9423681beb9a79215820f6bda73d0f \
                iv=e9aa8e834d8d70b7e0d254ff670dd718 serialize-iv=true ! \
        aesdec key=1f9423681beb9a79215820f6bda73d0f ! \
        kmssink

The aesdec module has been hacked to use an OP-TEE TA to decrypt the stream
into protected DMA-bufs which are consumed by the kmssink.

The primitive QEMU tests from previous patch sets can be tested on RockPi
in the same way using:
xtest --sdp-basic

The primitive tests are tested on QEMU with the following steps:
repo init -u https://github.com/jenswi-linaro/manifest.git -m qemu_v8.xml \
        -b prototype/sdp-v12
repo sync -j8
cd build
make toolchains -j$(nproc)
make SPMC_AT_EL=1 all -j$(nproc)
make SPMC_AT_EL=1 run-only
# login and at the prompt:
xtest --sdp-basic

The SPMC_AT_EL=1 parameter configures the build with FF-A and an SPMC at
S-EL1 inside OP-TEE. The parameter can be changed to SPMC_AT_EL=n to test
without FF-A using the original SMC ABI instead. Please remember to do
%make arm-tf-clean
for TF-A to be rebuilt properly using the new configuration.

https://optee.readthedocs.io/en/latest/building/prerequisites.html
list dependencies required to build the above.

The primitive tests are pretty basic, mostly checking that a Trusted
Application in the secure world can access and manipulate the memory. There
are also some negative tests for out of bounds buffers, etc.

Thanks,
Jens

Changes since V11:
* In "dma-buf: dma-heap: export declared functions":
  - use EXPORT_SYMBOL_NS_GPL()
  - Added TJ's R-B and Sumit's Ack
* In "tee: implement protected DMA-heap", import the namespaces "DMA_BUF"
  and "DMA_BUF_HEAP" as needed.

Changes since V10:
* Changed the new ABI OPTEE_MSG_CMD_GET_PROTMEM_CONFIG to report a list
  of u32 memory attributes instead of u16 endpoints to make room for both
  endpoint and access permissions in each entry.
* In "tee: new ioctl to a register tee_shm from a dmabuf file descriptor",
  remove the unused path for DMA-bufs allocated by other means than the on
  in the TEE SS.
* In "tee: implement protected DMA-heap", handle unloading of the
  backend driver module implementing the heap. The heap is reference
  counted and also calls tee_device_get() to guarantee that the module
  remains available while the heap is instantiated.
* In "optee: support protected memory allocation", use
  dma_coerce_mask_and_coherent() instead of open-coding the function.
* Added Sumit's R-B to
  - "optee: smc abi: dynamic protected memory allocation"
  - "optee: FF-A: dynamic protected memory allocation"
  - "optee: support protected memory allocation"
  - "tee: implement protected DMA-heap"
  - "dma-buf: dma-heap: export declared functions"

Changes since V9:
* Adding Sumit's R-B to "optee: sync secure world ABI headers"
* Update commit message as requested for "dma-buf: dma-heap: export
  declared functions".
* In "tee: implement protected DMA-heap":
  - add the hidden config option TEE_DMABUF_HEAPS to tell if the TEE
    subsystem can support DMA heaps
  - add a pfn_valid() to check that the passed physical address can be
    used by __pfn_to_page() and friends
  - remove the memremap() call, the caller is should do that instead if
    needed
* In "tee: add tee_shm_alloc_dma_mem()" guard the calls to
  dma_alloc_pages() and dma_free_pages() with TEE_DMABUF_HEAPS to avoid
  linking errors in some configurations
* In "optee: support protected memory allocation":
  - add the hidden config option OPTEE_STATIC_PROTMEM_POOL to tell if the
    driver can support a static protected memory pool
  - optee_protmem_pool_init() is slightly refactored to make the patches
    that follow easier
  - Call devm_memremap() before calling tee_protmem_static_pool_alloc()

Changes since V8:
* Using dma_alloc_pages() instead of cma_alloc() so the direct dependency on
  CMA can be removed together with the patches
  "cma: export cma_alloc() and cma_release()" and
  "dma-contiguous: export dma_contiguous_default_area". The patch
* Renaming the patch "tee: add tee_shm_alloc_cma_phys_mem()" to
  "tee: add tee_shm_alloc_dma_mem()"
* Setting DMA mask for the OP-TEE TEE device based on input from the secure
  world instead of relying on the parent device so following patches are
  removed: "tee: tee_device_alloc(): copy dma_mask from parent device" and
  "optee: pass parent device to tee_device_alloc()".
* Adding Sumit Garg's R-B to "tee: refactor params_from_user()"
* In the patch "tee: implement protected DMA-heap", map the physical memory
  passed to tee_protmem_static_pool_alloc().

Changes since V7:
* Adding "dma-buf: dma-heap: export declared functions",
  "cma: export cma_alloc() and cma_release()", and
  "dma-contiguous: export dma_contiguous_default_area" to export the symbols
  needed to keep the TEE subsystem as a load module.
* Removing CONFIG_TEE_DMABUF_HEAP and CONFIG_TEE_CMA since they aren't
  needed any longer.
* Addressing review comments in "optee: sync secure world ABI headers"
* Better align protected memory pool initialization between the smc-abi and
  ffa-abi parts of the optee driver.
* Removing the patch "optee: account for direction while converting parameters"

Changes since V6:
* Restricted memory is now known as protected memory since to use the same
  term as https://docs.vulkan.org/guide/latest/protected.html. Update all
  patches to consistently use protected memory.
* In "tee: implement protected DMA-heap" add the hidden config option
  TEE_DMABUF_HEAP to tell if the DMABUF_HEAPS functions are available
  for the TEE subsystem
* Adding "tee: refactor params_from_user()", broken out from the patch
  "tee: new ioctl to a register tee_shm from a dmabuf file descriptor"
* For "tee: new ioctl to a register tee_shm from a dmabuf file descriptor":
  - Update commit message to mention protected memory
  - Remove and open code tee_shm_get_parent_shm() in param_from_user_memref()
* In "tee: add tee_shm_alloc_cma_phys_mem" add the hidden config option
  TEE_CMA to tell if the CMA functions are available for the TEE subsystem
* For "tee: tee_device_alloc(): copy dma_mask from parent device" and
  "optee: pass parent device to tee_device_alloc", added
  Reviewed-by: Sumit Garg <sumit.garg@kernel.org>

Changes since V5:
* Removing "tee: add restricted memory allocation" and
  "tee: add TEE_IOC_RSTMEM_FD_INFO"
* Adding "tee: implement restricted DMA-heap",
  "tee: new ioctl to a register tee_shm from a dmabuf file descriptor",
  "tee: add tee_shm_alloc_cma_phys_mem()",
  "optee: pass parent device to tee_device_alloc()", and
  "tee: tee_device_alloc(): copy dma_mask from parent device"
* The two TEE driver OPs "rstmem_alloc()" and "rstmem_free()" are replaced
  with a struct tee_rstmem_pool abstraction.
* Replaced the the TEE_IOC_RSTMEM_ALLOC user space API with the DMA-heap API

Changes since V4:
* Adding the patch "tee: add TEE_IOC_RSTMEM_FD_INFO" needed by the
  GStreamer demo
* Removing the dummy CPU access and mmap functions from the dma_buf_ops
* Fixing a compile error in "optee: FF-A: dynamic restricted memory allocation"
  reported by kernel test robot <lkp@intel.com>

Changes since V3:
* Make the use_case and flags field in struct tee_shm u32's instead of
  u16's
* Add more description for TEE_IOC_RSTMEM_ALLOC in the header file
* Import namespace DMA_BUF in module tee, reported by lkp@intel.com
* Added a note in the commit message for "optee: account for direction
  while converting parameters" why it's needed
* Factor out dynamic restricted memory allocation from
  "optee: support restricted memory allocation" into two new commits
  "optee: FF-A: dynamic restricted memory allocation" and
  "optee: smc abi: dynamic restricted memory allocation"
* Guard CMA usage with #ifdef CONFIG_CMA, effectively disabling dynamic
  restricted memory allocate if CMA isn't configured

Changes since the V2 RFC:
* Based on v6.12
* Replaced the flags for SVP and Trusted UID memory with a u32 field with
  unique id for each use case
* Added dynamic allocation of restricted memory pools
* Added OP-TEE ABI both with and without FF-A for dynamic restricted memory
* Added support for FF-A with FFA_LEND

Changes since the V1 RFC:
* Based on v6.11
* Complete rewrite, replacing the restricted heap with TEE_IOC_RSTMEM_ALLOC

Changes since Olivier's post [2]:
* Based on Yong Wu's post [1] where much of dma-buf handling is done in
  the generic restricted heap
* Simplifications and cleanup
* New commit message for "dma-buf: heaps: add Linaro restricted dmabuf heap
  support"
* Replaced the word "secure" with "restricted" where applicable
