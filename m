kernel log + lspci + glxinfo + patch

The radeon driver crashes because of an over temperature of my
AMD Cape Verde Pro graphic card.

On my system, there's no overclocking, and the power management mode is the
default one, with power_method dpm, power_dpm_state balanced and
power_dpm_force_performance_level auto.
This GPU is used for display and opencl computing.

The default over temperature value in r600_dpm is 120C, which seems to be too
high for this chip/card.
I patched my system to have a 100C limit, and I've no crash anymore.
(I tried 110C, and it's still too high).

Attached are the full kernel log of the crash event, the lspci and glxinfo for
the graphic card, and the proposed patch.
