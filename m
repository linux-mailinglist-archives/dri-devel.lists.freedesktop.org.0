For now I'll keep them at the head of this RFC and as they get acked or 
r-b-ed I can easily send them standalone or re-ordered. Until then 
having the series separate would make the RFC not standalone.

We already covered this in the thread with Philipp to a degree. Tl;dr; 
the main idea is whether we simplify the code and at least not regress.

I don't expect improvements on the amdgpu side with the workloads like 
games and benchmarks. I did not measure anything significant apart that 
priorities seem to work with the run queues removed.

Where something could show is if someone is aware of a workload where 
normal prio starves low. Since one part of the idea is that with the 
"deadline" scheme those should work a little bit more balanced.

Also again, feedback (including testing feedback from other drivers) 
would be great, and ideas of which workloads to test.

Btw I will send a respin in a day or so which will clean up some things 
and adds some more tiny bits.

Tvrtko
