While setting up the reduction, I noticed that there is an instance of
-Wmaybe-uninitialized at this site. Seems odd that it is not sure, I will
reduce on that.

  ../drivers/gpu/host1x/dev.c: In function 'host1x_probe':
  ../drivers/gpu/host1x/dev.c:520:12: error: 'syncpt_irq' may be used uninitialized [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
    520 |         if (syncpt_irq < 0)
        |            ^
  ../drivers/gpu/host1x/dev.c:490:13: note: 'syncpt_irq' was declared here
    490 |         int syncpt_irq;
        |             ^~~~~~~~~~
  cc1: all warnings being treated as errors

Cheers,
Nathan
