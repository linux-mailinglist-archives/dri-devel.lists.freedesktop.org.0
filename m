type_ should actually be the constants that you were looking at before. In
retrospect we probably should make a custom enum for it, I think the only
reason I was hesistant to do this was because of the possibility of additio=
nal
constants being added in the future.=20

Definitely not, doing so would break DRM since the connector is basically
always stored in linked lists.
