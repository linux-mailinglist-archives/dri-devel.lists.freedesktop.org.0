Well exactly that's the point I'm raising: The client *must* understand 
that!

See we need to be able to handle all restrictions here, coherency of the 
data is just one of them.

For example the much more important question is the location of the data 
and for this allocating from the V4L2 device is in most cases just not 
going to fly.

The more common case is that you need to allocate from the GPU and then 
import that into the V4L2 device. The background is that all dGPUs I 
know of need the data inside local memory (VRAM) to be able to scan out 
from it.

Well x86 pretty much has the same restrictions.

For example the scanout buffer is usually always in local memory because 
you often scan out at up to 120Hz while your recording is only 30fps and 
most of the time lower resolution.

Pumping all that data 120 time a second over the PCIe bus would just not 
be doable in a lot of use cases.

That's pretty much exactly what my patch set does. It just keeps 
userspace out of the way and says that creating the initial connection 
between the devices fails if they can't talk directly with each other.

Maybe we should move that into userspace so that the involved components 
know of hand that a certain approach won't work?

No, as I said. Explicit handover points are just an absolutely no-go. We 
just have way to many use cases which don't work with that idea.

As I said we made the same mistake with the DMA-Api and even more 20 
years later are still running into problems because of that.

Just try to run any dGPU under a XEN hypervisor with memory 
fragmentation for a very good example why this is such a bad idea.

Christian.
