Of course meant to say that clock(-name)s has **7** items, not 6.

Konrad, can you clarify why other

I don't know either, but we need this information to decide whether to
use `maxItems: 6`:

1. Directly on the property;
2. In an `else:` case on the current `if: sm6375-dpu` (should have the
   same effect as 1., afaik);
3. In a second `if:` case that lists all SoCS explicitly.

Since we don't have this information, I think option 3. is the right way
to go, setting `maxItems: 6` for qcom,sm6125-dpu.

However, it is not yet understood why downstream is able to use the
throttle clock without repercussions.

> We talk here about this patch.

We used this patch to discover that other SoCs are similarly
unconstrained.  But if you don't want me to look into it, by all means!
Saves me a lot of time.  So I will go with option 3.
