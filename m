(I was on holiday yesterday and didn't want to spend a sunny
afternoon doing bisects.)

I've just done that and it is bad.

Is there any way to bisect through the parts of the
drm merge patch into v5.10-rc1 ?

That ought to be quicker (and less error prone) than
the bisect builds I was doing.

Note that the stack 'splat' is due to a later change.
It is separate from the broken pixel alignment.

I actually saw the vga text go 'funny' while the boot
was outputting all the [OK] messages (from systemd?)
before the graphic login stole tty1 (bloody stupid
to use tty1).

I don't need to use the failing system today, I'll
have another go at isolating the failure.

	David
