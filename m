we = amd, for everybody else that is certainly a different topic.

But for now AMD is the only one running into this problem.

Could be that Nouveau sees this as well with the next hw generation, but 
who knows?

MM=multimedia, e.g. UVD, VCE, VCN engines on AMD hardware.

Yeah, that part makes perfectly sense. But I don't see the problem with 
that?

Why?

As far as I see that should still work perfectly fine and I have the 
strong feeling I'm missing something here.

Well I'm trying to figure out why you see it as such a problem to keep 
implicit sync around.

As far as I can tell it is completely octagonal if we use 
implicit/explicit and dma_fence/user_fence.

It's just a different implementation inside the kernel.
