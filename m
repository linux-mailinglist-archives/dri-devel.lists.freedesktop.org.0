--- Comment #3 from Matt McDonald (gardotd426@gmail.com) ---
This is the card and its specifications from the official website:
https://www.sapphiretech.com/en/consumer/pulse-radeon-rx-5600-xt-6g-gddr6#Specification

As you'll see, memory clock is supposed to be 14Gbps on the new vBIOS, which is
equal to 1750MHz, which is exactly what GPU-z reports on Windows (as does every
other piece of GPU monitoring software like MSI Afterburner and Radeon
Wattman). And if you look at the specs for the card with the old performance
vBIOS, it was 12Gbps effective which is 1500MHz, and again GPU-z and every
other windows utility correctly reports this. Also, Linux correctly reports
memory clock frequency for older cards like the RX 580, my XFX GTS XXX model
was correctly reported at memory clock boosting to 1750 MHz

However with the 5600 XT, even with overclocking enabled, the powerplay tables
range is only 930MHz at the maximum end.
