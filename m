I won't reiterate my original troubles with this logic and the comment
as that has well been described in v5 replies.

Just want to ask why this comment couldn't be added in patch 5/6
immediately when the logic is introduced?  Now readers won't have a clue
what is going on until they skip one patch ahead.

Furthermore it is lacking any explanation that this is a workaround for
cmd-mode, and that porches are currently used to represent "transfer
time" until those calculations are implemented.  At that point there is
no concept of "not adjusting porches for compressed signals" anymore.

Still very glad to have this, thank you for adding it.  Note that it
only further undermines the pclk adjustments, as I just explained in v5
review.
