The wrapper is already handled by the ti-sysc binding, the sgx
binding should be standard with optional clocks.

See for example the standard 8250 uart for am335x with:

$ git grep -B20 -A10 uart0 arch/arm/boot/dts/am33xx-l4.dtsi

The 8250 device configuration is described in the standard 8250
dts binding, and the am335x module in the ti-sysc binding.
The are separate devices :)

So for the sgx binding, you can just leave out TI specific
module wrapper completely from the example.

Well if other SoCs implement genpd domains etc, that's then
again part of a separate binding and not part of the sgx binding.
