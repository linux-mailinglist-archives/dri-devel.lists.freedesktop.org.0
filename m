This was merely an example. What I wanted to say is that we need to 
support system already deployed.

In other words our customers won't accept that they need to replace the 
compositor just because they switch to a new hardware generation.

Well how the handling for new Android, distributions etc... is going to 
look like is a completely different story.

And I completely agree with both Daniel Vetter and you that we need to 
keep this in mind when designing the compatibility with older software.

For Android I'm really not sure what to do. In general Android is 
already trying to do the right thing by using explicit sync, the problem 
is that this is build around the idea that this explicit sync is 
syncfile kernel based.

Either we need to change Android and come up with something that works 
with user fences as well or we somehow invent a compatibility layer for 
syncfile as well.

Regards,
Christian.
