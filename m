Maybe there could be a mechanism which allows the compositor in the guest to automatically adjust its repaint cycle as needed.

This might even be possible without requiring changes in each compositor, by adjusting the vertical blank periods in the guest to be aligned with the host compositor repaint cycles. Not sure about that though.

Even if not, both this series or making it possible to queue multiple flips require corresponding changes in each compositor as well to have any effect.
