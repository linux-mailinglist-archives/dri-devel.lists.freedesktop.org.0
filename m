--- Comment #1 from alekshs@hotmail.com ---
I think I discovered what's the issue by playing with a utility called
RyzenAdj.

With RyzenAdj when setting the igp freq to 200 from 400 it doesn't do much for
power consumption. It's when I play with the CPU-GPU speed parameter (fabric
speed?) that power consumption goes down significantly. 

So apparently power_dpm_force_performance_level to low sets both MHz and fabric
speed lower. The first wouldn't make sense to affect CPU performance, the
second is known to affect it - so after thinking about it more, I don't think
it's a bug.
