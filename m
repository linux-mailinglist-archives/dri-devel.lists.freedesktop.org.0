No thecommit message is very clear, just you don't clear. Can't you see that 
only you are out of scope here and complaining with wrong hypothesis?

No, you miss and mess everything.

It can also be platform device with manually assigned software node.

Yes, I admit it, its not the first time you do such a thing.  I know you might
good at debating and directing blindly. But those skills are not really helpful.
As it brings ZERO benefits to the developers and end user of Linux kernel. What
the end user need is a good DRM driver and infrastructure like i915, amdgpu,
radeon, vc4, ast, X server or wayland etc.

Its fine to keep quite if you don't understand something very well, especially,
the for the things that not directly maintained by you. As you don't have to
responsible for it and you don't need to pay for the obligation. You might
deceive yourself to believe that you are reviewing, actually, you are just
wasting your time as well as other people's time.
  
If the the commit message is really matters to you, then do you thing about
the following series [1][2][3] ?

[1] https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/series/123812/
[2] https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/579730/?series=130021&rev=2
[3] https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/series/123737/

How about the witting of its commit message, very well, right?
Think before you type, and type with the brain not with the emotion.
