We know that we should do this job cleanly.

But i am worry about the troubles it may cause when  send patch with my 
company email(suijingfeng <suijingfeng@loongson.cn>)

So I just follow the my conventional way of sending patch about this 
series,

I will use my company email(suijingfeng <suijingfeng@loongson.cn>) in 
the future.
