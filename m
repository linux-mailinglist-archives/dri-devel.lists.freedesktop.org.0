Except the MX8M support is all in-tree now, so please drop the 
"out-of-tree" argument. That I am using 6.1.y on those platforms in 
production makes no difference.

That's just trading breaking one set of users for breaking another set 
of users.

Since I have no access to the QCOM hardware or datasheet, can you have a 
look at the NXP.com MX8M M/N/P datasheets (those are available) and 
compare their behavior with the QCOM behavior ? I assume you do have the 
QCOM datasheets available.
