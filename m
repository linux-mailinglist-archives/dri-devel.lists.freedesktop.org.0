If amdgpu_gfx_off_ctrl was called with enable=true when adev->gfx.gfx_off_req_count == 0 already, it could have prevented amdgpu_device_delay_enable_gfx_off from locking the mutex.

v3 solves this by only scheduling the work when adev->gfx.gfx_off_req_count transitions from 1 to 0, which means it no longer needs to lock the mutex.
