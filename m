So how was this module loaded then? I suppose if the user does insmod, the 
softdep wouldn't be honored but modprobe should load the dependencies 
first.

Right, and that indirect route is why it won't be made as hard 
dependency.

Fine.

You can put the comment if you want but I understood that even without 
the comment. I was just interested in how that magic number 906 was 
derived and if it could have been better defined.

I think you can leave the line as is.
