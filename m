Ok. The panel driver itself works fine with some changes in other DRM drivers.
In fact, it will not need any changes, assuming the to be proposed fixes to
dw-mipi-dsi will pass, too. So I don't have many objections against this driver
itself.

I'm not sure I should be giving reviewed-by to driver I co-wrote. :) Anyway,
I checked it again, and only issue I found was that shutdown callback tries
to disable the panel even if it may already be disabled, which will lead to
unbalanced calls to regulator_disable functions, which may produce some needless
warnings on shutdown/reboot.

So if you want to commit this driver now, go ahead. DT will need one more round.

As you say, the overall usable support for Pinephone Pro in mainline is still
way off into the future, so I agree it's not necessary to get hung up on these
issues. I can do a DT revision + add in the other suggested DRM patches, so that
there's at least a searchable public record of the remaining issues.

kind regards,
	o.
