I don't know if I'm the only one affected by this issue, but I've just
received today two months of e-mails from x.org, including all the
reminders aboud membership renewal and election nomination period. This
isn't the first time this happens, and the last time I was told there
was no automated process to quick the mail queues when errors happen,
making mails pile up forever on x.org's side until someone handles it
manually. This is something you really want to automate, or at least
monitored.
