Feel free to ask, I doubt that will work out, but yes, in the end it's
Linus decision.

That's not the case and thus a misleading example afaics. Here someone
created a virtual PCI device that seems to be compatible to the original
(just like someone created a virtual cirrus device with Qemu that worked
with the original cirrus drivers -- with the difference in this case
that both original and compatible devices are virtual). And it seemed
like that compatible virtual device worked fine with the driver for the
original device for people. Then by kernel standards you are not allowed
to break this setup with any changes you make to the driver, even if the
driver was only meant for the original device. Not sure, maybe that is
even not to hard by using quirks or something if the compatible GPU can
be detected (in this case the one from VirtualBox)?
