This set seems to depend on Jakub's memory provider patches and a netdev
driver change which is not included. For the testing mentioned here, you
must have a tree + branch with all of the patches. Is it publicly available?

It would be interesting to see how well (easy) this integrates with
io_uring. Besides avoiding all of the syscalls for receiving the iov and
releasing the buffers back to the pool, io_uring also brings in the
ability to seed a page_pool with registered buffers which provides a
means to get simpler Rx ZC for host memory.

Overall I like the intent and possibilities for extensions, but a lot of
details are missing - perhaps some are answered by seeing an end-to-end
implementation.
