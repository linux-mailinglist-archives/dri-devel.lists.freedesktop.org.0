Path for 5.4.27 to fix framebuffer

Hi,

we have some ancient software which uses DirectFB to draw to the framebuffer
during installation.
After upgrading from kernel 4.14.99 to 5.4.27 the framebuffer stall the GPU and
only a black image was shown. This could be reprocuded on an Igel UD 7
(CARRIZO) and a Lenovo 14w (STONEY) lspci -vv is attached from both devices.

We did some more investigation to find the breaking change please see attached
git bisect log:

6c8d74caa2fa33908ecd07fb1cf1b7bc629b367a is the first bad commit

After finding the bad commit we reverted the changes on the 5.4.27 and
framebuffer started working again. Patch for reverting is also attached.

Kind regards,
Jan Burgmeier
