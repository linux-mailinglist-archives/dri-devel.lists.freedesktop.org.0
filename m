Just for those who want to try the latest version of DEPT.

Hi Linus and folks,

I've been developing a tool for detecting deadlock possibilities by
tracking wait/event rather than lock(?) acquisition order to try to
cover all synchonization machanisms. It's done on v6.2-rc2.

https://github.com/lgebyungchulpark/linux-dept/commits/dept2.0_on_v6.2-rc2

Benifit:

	0. Works with all lock primitives.
	1. Works with wait_for_completion()/complete().
	2. Works with 'wait' on PG_locked.
	3. Works with 'wait' on PG_writeback.
	4. Works with swait/wakeup.
	5. Works with waitqueue.
	6. Multiple reports are allowed.
	7. Deduplication control on multiple reports.
	8. Withstand false positives thanks to 6.
	9. Easy to tag any wait/event.

Future work:

	0. To make it more stable.
	1. To separates Dept from Lockdep.
	2. To improves performance in terms of time and space.
	3. To use Dept as a dependency engine for Lockdep.
	4. To add any missing tags of wait/event in the kernel.
	5. To deduplicate stack trace.

How to interpret reports:

	1. E(event) in each context cannot be triggered because of the
	   W(wait) that cannot be woken.
	2. The stack trace helping find the problematic code is located
	   in each conext's detail.

Thanks,
Byungchul

Changes from v6:

	1. Tie to task scheduler code to track sleep and try_to_wake_up()
	   assuming sleeps cause waits, try_to_wake_up()s would be the
	   events that those are waiting for, of course with proper DEPT
	   annotations, sdt_might_sleep_weak(), sdt_might_sleep_strong()
	   and so on. For these cases, class is classified at sleep
	   entrance rather than the synchronization initialization code.
	   Which would extremely reduce false alarms.
	2. Remove the DEPT associated instance in each page struct for
	   tracking dependencies by PG_locked and PG_writeback thanks to
	   the 1. work above.
	3. Introduce CONFIG_DEPT_AGGRESIVE_TIMEOUT_WAIT to suppress
	   reports that waits with timeout set are involved, for those
	   who don't like verbose reporting.
	4. Add a mechanism to refill the internal memory pools on
	   running out so that DEPT could keep working as long as free
	   memory is available in the system.
	5. Re-enable tracking hashed-waitqueue wait. That's going to no
	   longer generate false positives because class is classified
	   at sleep entrance rather than the waitqueue initailization.
	6. Refactor to make it easier to port onto each new version of
	   the kernel.
	7. Apply DEPT to dma fence.
	8. Do trivial optimizaitions.

Changes from v5:

	1. Use just pr_warn_once() rather than WARN_ONCE() on the lack
	   of internal resources because WARN_*() printing stacktrace is
	   too much for informing the lack. (feedback from Ted, Hyeonggon)
	2. Fix trivial bugs like missing initializing a struct before
	   using it.
	3. Assign a different class per task when handling onstack
	   variables for waitqueue or the like. Which makes Dept
	   distinguish between onstack variables of different tasks so
	   as to prevent false positives. (reported by Hyeonggon)
	4. Make Dept aware of even raw_local_irq_*() to prevent false
	   positives. (reported by Hyeonggon)
	5. Don't consider dependencies between the events that might be
	   triggered within __schedule() and the waits that requires
	    __schedule(), real ones. (reported by Hyeonggon)
	6. Unstage the staged wait that has prepare_to_wait_event()'ed
	   *and* yet to get to __schedule(), if we encounter __schedule()
	   in-between for another sleep, which is possible if e.g. a
	   mutex_lock() exists in 'condition' of ___wait_event().
	7. Turn on CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING when CONFIG_DEPT is on, to rely
	   on the hardirq and softirq entrance tracing to make Dept more
	   portable for now.

Changes from v4:

	1. Fix some bugs that produce false alarms.
	2. Distinguish each syscall context from another *for arm64*.
	3. Make it not warn it but just print it in case Dept ring
	   buffer gets exhausted. (feedback from Hyeonggon)
	4. Explicitely describe "EXPERIMENTAL" and "Dept might produce
	   false positive reports" in Kconfig. (feedback from Ted)

Changes from v3:

	1. Dept shouldn't create dependencies between different depths
	   of a class that were indicated by *_lock_nested(). Dept
	   normally doesn't but it does once another lock class comes
	   in. So fixed it. (feedback from Hyeonggon)
	2. Dept considered a wait as a real wait once getting to
	   __schedule() even if it has been set to TASK_RUNNING by wake
	   up sources in advance. Fixed it so that Dept doesn't consider
	   the case as a real wait. (feedback from Jan Kara)
	3. Stop tracking dependencies with a map once the event
	   associated with the map has been handled. Dept will start to
	   work with the map again, on the next sleep.

Changes from v2:

	1. Disable Dept on bit_wait_table[] in sched/wait_bit.c
	   reporting a lot of false positives, which is my fault.
	   Wait/event for bit_wait_table[] should've been tagged in a
	   higher layer for better work, which is a future work.
	   (feedback from Jan Kara)
	2. Disable Dept on crypto_larval's completion to prevent a false
	   positive.

Changes from v1:

	1. Fix coding style and typo. (feedback from Steven)
	2. Distinguish each work context from another in workqueue.
	3. Skip checking lock acquisition with nest_lock, which is about
	   correct lock usage that should be checked by Lockdep.

Changes from RFC(v0):

	1. Prevent adding a wait tag at prepare_to_wait() but __schedule().
	   (feedback from Linus and Matthew)
	2. Use try version at lockdep_acquire_cpus_lock() annotation.
	3. Distinguish each syscall context from another.
