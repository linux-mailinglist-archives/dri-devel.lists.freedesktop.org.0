I think you mean wake_up_interruptible(). That would be
drm_sched_job_done(), on the fence callback when a job completes, which
as I keep saying is the same logic used for
hw_rq_count/hw_submission_limit tracking.

Please think about it for a second, it's really not that complicated to
see why it works:

- Driver pops off completed commands <-- can_run_job condition satisfied
- Driver signals fence
 - drm_sched_job_done_cb()
  - drm_sched_job_done()
   - atomic_dec(&sched->hw_rq_count); <-- hw_submission_limit satisfied
   - ...
   - wake_up_interruptible(&sched->wake_up_worker);
      ^- happens after both conditions are potentially satisfied

It really is completely equivalent to just making the hw_rq_count logic
customizable by the driver. The actual flow is the same. As long as the
driver guarantees it satisfies the can_run_job() condition before
signaling the completion fence that triggered that change, it works fine.

> As I said this idea came up before and was rejected multiple times.

Maybe it was a different idea, or maybe it was rejected for other
reasons, or maybe it was wrongly rejected for being broken when it isn't ^^
