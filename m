Yes, the platform is upstream.  The 8998 laptops (clamshell).  It is the 
ti-sn65si86.  I suspect the I2C connection was not populated for cost 
reasons, then determined its much more convenient to have it as every 
generation after that I've seen has the I2C.

If you check the datasheet closely, the I2C connection is optional.  You 
can also configure the bridge inband using DSI commands.  This is what 
the FW and Windows does.

So, the DT binding needs to make the I2C property optional (this should 
be backwards compatible).  The driver needs to detect that the I2C 
connection is not provided, and fall back to DSI commands.  Regmap would 
be nice for this, but I got pushback on the proposal.  Then I got 
sidetracked looking at other issues.
