With vmwgfx there is another issue that is hit when the gpu signals an 
error. At that point the batch might be restarted with a new meta 
command buffer that needs to be allocated out of a dma pool. in the 
fence critical section. That's probably a bit nasty to fix, but not 
impossible.

Hmm, yes. Another potential big problem would be drivers that want to 
use gpu page faults in the dma-fence critical sections with the 
batch-based programming model.
