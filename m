Maybe it can. both issues were pointed out during review of the first
series, there was no improvement here. I'd really ask to perform
conversion of a single driver, so that the script (or post-script
fixups) can be improved. I'd still expect that Anusha actually reviews
the changed driver before posting it and verifies that there is no
regression in the logic / error reporting.
