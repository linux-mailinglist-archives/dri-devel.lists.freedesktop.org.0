Thanks!

No-one here mentioned uncompressed pixels?

None of this code suddenly makes DPU send twice as many pixels/bytes to
the DSI, yet we are enabling a feature that makes the bus twice as wide,
so the clock can be halved *for comressed pixels*?

Then send less patches!  As long as there is activity on the mailing
list there'll always be questions going back and forth, and I don't
think that's unreasonable.

Unless you want to push patches into mainline without questioning.

Would love to hear, why, for compressed streams, the bus is twice as
wide yet pclk is not reduced to account for that.

And here we start talking about uncompressed pixels *separately*.  Okay,
if it is not supported (e.g. widebus is specific to / reserved for DSC)
it of course makes no sense to add it.
