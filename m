Context does not have an engine mask in the uapi so I'd explain this in 
terms of list of engines.

s/If/if, I think.

I don't find CSX[0] readable nor I think introducing csx as a term is 
desirable. Lowercase cs<n> (like cs0) is what I would prefer for both 
readability and likely cs = command streamer could be more obvious what 
it is. Naming like rcs0 (prefix-cs-number) and similar are exposed in 
kernel logs and error state while csx[] (cs-suffix-number) are not at all.

In placement examples I would refrain from using any prefixes/suffixes 
to designate engine classes and just say cs0/cs1, mentioning the 
same/mixed class requirement separately in the notes if applicable.

Again, I wouldn't use the term logically contiguous here because logical 
instance numbering isn't used in class:instance addressing as used in 
engine maps.

engines[][] = {
   /* Channel 0 possible engines: */ { cs0, cs2 },
   /* Channel 1 possible engines: */ { cs1, cs3 },
};

Would this be accurate and descriptive on top of the formula? Although I 
am not too happy with the term channel without first explaining how we 
are going to call parallel streams within a wide context.

It's not that confusing really. If we had added multi-batch execbuf from 
the start no one would be talking about bonds today.
