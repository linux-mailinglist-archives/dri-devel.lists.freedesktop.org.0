I noticed this warning when running checkpatch myself, and while a return isn't strictly
necessary, I thought there was no point in going down the function when no more bytes
could be written into the format string because it's already full.

I did check the code for other locations where flow control is happening inside a macro
and found this:

#define group_queue_work(group, wname) \
	do { \
		group_get(group); \
		if (!queue_work((group)->ptdev->scheduler->wq, &(group)->wname ## _work)) \
			group_put(group); \
	} while (0)

although I'm not sure whether the do {} while (0) is right there to make the warning go away.

Good catch, I don't know why I thought snprintf() would print at most 'flags_len
- offset' bytes, and would return exactly that count at most too, rather than
throwing a hypothetical max value. Then maybe checking whether 'if (offset >=
flags_len)' would be enough ?

This looks good to me. However, I'm starting to wonder whether it makes sense to
try to come up with a very elaborate flag formatting scheme, because of two
reasons:

- It messes up with the output because we need to provide enough headroom in
case the flag set will increase in the future. This is not a big deal because
the debugfs file is meant to be parsed by UM tools, but ...

- In case we go over the space available to print flags, not printing the
remaining ones feels even less informative than printing let's say a hexadecimal
mask, because parsing tools would rather deal with no missing data than the
absence of human-readable flag names.

On top of that, I think, while these flags could be mostly of interest to parsing
tools, they'd be less so to someone casually peeking into the raw textual
output. I think they'd be mostly interested in the process which triggered
their creation, their size, virtual address in the VM, and above all their name
(potentially a very long one).

With all these things born in mind, I'd say we'd best just print a 32 bit mask
for both flag fields, for which we'd always know the exact span in bytes, and
then print all the available flag names in the debugfs file prelude for parsing
tools to pick up on.
