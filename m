So the idea is to make these kerneldoc and pull them into the rfc section.
Then when we merge, move them to the real uapi section, like what Matt has
done for lmem.

Would be good to also move this into the kerneldoc (maybe add labelled
list for flags or so) so it shows up in the render output.

So I get the history now behind this, but I think specifying flags for the
only behaviour you can get and the only behaviour that userspace asks for
is silly.

I think we should just move the actual behaviour spec into the kerneldoc,
as in "this is the bonding you get" and "due to hw/fw limitations these
workloads will be non-preemptable" and call it a day. Trying to guess
future needs and specifying them, without knowing those future needs
precisely, much less having an implementation, just never works out
really.

I discussed this a bit with Jason, and he's suggested this makes sense as
a engine flag, but definitely not on the parallel extension. But since we
don't have a need for picking a non-default value just extra work.

We should add here that "Furthermore I915_SUBMIT_FENCE is by design a
future fence, so not really something we should continue to support."

We've made it a CTX_CREATE_EXT extension, so really you don't have a

Addd here the kerneldoc include for your header.

Aside from the comments by and large this looks good. The main interface
at least is clear and warts-free.
