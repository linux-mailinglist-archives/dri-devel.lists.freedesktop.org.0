Ish, honestly I think `Ref` from RefCell is really the closest approximatio=
n
of this. The problem is that we want to allow mutation of an atomic state, =
but
because you typically modify numerous object states in a single object's
atomic state, we can't just pull a &mut from the AtomicState object without
quickly making things really painful to work with. As just using plain muta=
ble
references means you have to drop one object's state out of scope to work w=
ith
a different object's state.

As such, Borrowed*State is the runtime borrow of an atomic state for mutati=
on,
and the Composer is actually what keeps track of the bitmasks telling us wh=
ich
states are currently taken out so we can safely provide DerefMut without
breaking rust's data aliasing rules. The borrowed types can be mutated like
normal mutable references, but because they all are tracked by the Composer=
 at
runtime only one can be taken out at a time.

So I think the reason I did this was because atomic states are refcounted b=
y
default, but there's basically no situations where you'd have direct access=
 to
a AtomicStateMutator and want to modify that refcount - mutators are only e=
ver
provided in FFI callbacks. AtomicStateComposers on the other hand are a bit
different. Right now we only provide them in FFI callbacks, but the eventua=
l
plan is that if a driver needs to perform an atomic commit internally it wo=
uld
do something like this:

   let composer =3D AtomicStateComposer::<KmsDriver>::new();
  =20
   let mut crtc_state =3D some_crtc.get_new_state(&composer)?;
  =20
   crtc_state.cool_state =3D cool_value;
  =20
   let committed_state =3D composer.commit()?;

Where mutators basically are never modifying the refcount, a composer might
actually do so. If one of the steps here failed (getting the new state for =
the
CRTC could fail with -EDEADLK, commit() could fail due to a atomic check
failure, etc.) then we want to make sure that if we leave the scope of the
function that the underlying AtomicState in the AtomicStateComposer actuall=
y
has the reference to it dropped. Since a composer is just a mutator that ca=
n
add stuff, it made sense to have it manually invoke the drop() call for the
AtomicState<> once it's dropped.

That being said - we could certainly get rid of this and just make all
instances of AtomicStateMutator be created within ManuallyDrop, but it seem=
ed
a bit more tedious to me considering we basically never want a mutator to d=
rop
a refcount.

whoops - I think I might have originally intended to call Borrowed state ty=
pes
composers as well but decided not to, and forgot to update the documentatio=
n.
Whoops :P.

Everything here should say mutator, and tbh - maybe it might be better to
rename the Borrowed types to mutators now that I think about it - as i thin=
k
it would make the purpose of all of these types a bit clearer.

Yeah this is just typos on my end. TBH these are new terms for KMS develope=
rs
as well, C doesn't really have the kind of restrictions rust does with
mutation so none of these concepts exist in C. I had to come up with all of
this terminology myself and I definitely waffled between different names a =
few
times while writing this up.

No I think that's a fair thing to point out. I'm more then open to alternat=
ive
names here, the thing I'm trying to get across in this comment is `connecto=
r`
doesn't change throughout the lifetime of the atomic state.

 write that

Nope, it's explicitly meant to be single threaded! The idea is that you rea=
lly
only work with a Borrowed state if you're in the context of mutating an ato=
mic
state, and atomic states are meant to only be mutated at points before they=
've
been "swapped in" to their respective modesetting object, at which point it
can then be read by multiple threads (and we no longer need to mutate
anything).

Note: it is possible for commit work to get deferred to a different thread,
but that is more like handing the commit off to a worker rather than the
commit being worked on in multiple threads at the same time. And the main
reason for that is non-blocking commits where we allow the commit process f=
or
the next commit to start before the previous commit is finished (it's,
complicated haha. Even when a non-blocking commit is running the state it's
going to eventually swap in is still only being accessed by that commit).
