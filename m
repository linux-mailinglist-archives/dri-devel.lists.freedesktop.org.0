Per context we have context image (register state etc) and ring buffer 
(command emission), per engine.

Then we have all the page table backing store per each VM/ppgtt/context 
allocated as GEM objects.

In a way yes and in a way it is not as elegant. IMHO at least.

It's not really special, just needed to return a tuple of (object, 
handle) from the prime import helper. So it can plug into the very same 
tracking I use from other paths.

I was going for some kind of elegance with one loop - single tracking - 
as long as I had to add new list head to our buffer object.

Anyway, I can re-spin a simplified version (fewer patches) with two 
loops. Only downside is that the new list head will only be used for 
internal objects.

Tvrtko

P.S.
Flink I indeed missed. Is that used nowadays btw?
