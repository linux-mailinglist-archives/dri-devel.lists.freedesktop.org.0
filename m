Yeah sounds all great!

I think interim at least a separate rust drm entry
would be good, to make sure we always cc both rust and dri-devel. Once
it's too much for you and you generally trust the dri-devel folks to not
design stupid interfaces, we can then drop that and only ping rust folks
when needed. I do expect that's some years out though.
