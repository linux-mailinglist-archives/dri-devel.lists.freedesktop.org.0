Just a quick reminder that a lot of users have this parameter set in 
their grub command line because of the incorrect assumption that quick 
sync requires the HuC which requires the GuC command submission.

Just bear that in mind and make sure there is a minimum of quality in 
the GuC backend before allowing users to use the GuC, even behind this 
kernel parameter.

Maybe a warning in the kernel logs saying that this feature is 
experimental, and use "enable_guc=1" for the fullest quick sync support 
will improve the user satisfaction, and save you some time handling 
unwanted bugs.

What's the plan to keep the comparison between GuC and execlists? The CI 
machines cannot just test the GuC as it would expose users to 
regressions in the default mode, and machines are hard to come by in the 
CI lab.

As much as I would like more consistency in the English language, 
simplier is not a word in the dictionary.

Can't parse this sentence. How about: "Minimum integration of the 
execlists backend in the DRM scheduler"?

Other than these typographical nitpicks, I think the plan is sane 
provided that you can find enough CI machines and add the warning.
