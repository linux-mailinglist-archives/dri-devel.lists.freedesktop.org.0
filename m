Correct, we wouldn't have synchronization between device with and 
without user queues any more.

That could only be a problem for A+I Laptops.

Memory management will just work with preemption fences which pause the 
user queues of a process before evicting something. That will be a 
dma_fence, but also a well known approach.

              &gt; The memory management doesn't have to use GPU page
              faults like HMM.<br>
              &gt; Instead, it can wait for user queues of a specific
              process to go idle and<br>
              &gt; then unmap the queues, so that userspace can't submit
              anything. Buffer<br>
              &gt; evictions, pinning, etc. can be executed when all
              queues are unmapped<br>
              &gt; (suspended). Thus, no BO fences and page faults are
              needed.<br>
              &gt; <br>
              &gt; Inter-process synchronization can use timeline
              semaphores. Userspace will<br>
              &gt; query the wait and signal value for a shared buffer
              from the kernel. The<br>
              &gt; kernel will keep a history of those queries to know
              which process is<br>
              &gt; responsible for signalling which buffer. There is
              only the wait-timeout<br>
              &gt; issue and how to identify the culprit. One of the
              solutions is to have the<br>
              &gt; GPU send all GPU signal commands and all timed out
              wait commands via an<br>
              &gt; interrupt to the kernel driver to monitor and
              validate userspace behavior.<br>
              &gt; With that, it can be identified whether the culprit
              is the waiting process<br>
              &gt; or the signalling process and which one. Invalid
              signal/wait parameters can<br>
              &gt; also be detected. The kernel can force-signal only
              the semaphores that time<br>
              &gt; out, and punish the processes which caused the
              timeout or used invalid<br>
              &gt; signal/wait parameters.<br>
              &gt; <br>
              &gt; The question is whether this synchronization solution
              is robust enough for<br>
              &gt; dma_fence and whatever the kernel and window systems

              The proper model here is the preempt-ctx dma_fence that
              amdkfd uses<br>
              (without page faults). That means dma_fence for
              synchronization is doa, at<br>
              least as-is, and we're back to figuring out the winsys
              problem.<br>
              <br>
              "We'll solve it with timeouts" is very tempting, but
              doesn't work. It's<br>
              akin to saying that we're solving deadlock issues in a
              locking design by<br>
              doing a global s/mutex_lock/mutex_lock_timeout/ in the

              avoids having to reach the reset button, but that's about
              it.<br>
              <br>
              And the fundamental problem is that once you throw in

              means you get deadlocks if you still use dma_fence for
              sync under<br>
              perfectly legit use-case. We've discussed that one ad
              nauseam last summer:<br>
              <br>
              <a

              <br>
              See silly diagramm at the bottom.<br>
              <br>
              Now I think all isn't lost, because imo the first step to
              getting to this<br>
              brave new world is rebuilding the driver on top of
              userspace fences, and<br>
              with the adjusted cmd submit model. You probably don't
              want to use amdkfd,<br>
              but port that as a context flag or similar to render nodes
              for gl/vk. Of<br>
              course that means you can only use this mode in headless,
              without<br>
              glx/wayland winsys support, but it's a start.<br>

              &gt; &gt;&gt; The thing is, you can't do this in
              drm/scheduler. At least not without<br>
              &gt; &gt;&gt; splitting up the dma_fence in the kernel
              into separate memory fences<br>
              &gt; &gt;&gt; and sync fences<br>
              &gt; &gt;<br>
              &gt; &gt;<br>
              &gt; &gt; I'm starting to think this thread needs its own
              glossary ...<br>
              &gt; &gt;<br>
              &gt; &gt; I propose we use 'residency fence' for execution
              fences which enact<br>
              &gt; &gt; memory-residency operations, e.g. faulting in a
              page ultimately depending<br>
              &gt; &gt; on GPU work retiring.<br>
              &gt; &gt;<br>
              &gt; &gt; And 'value fence' for the pure-userspace model
              suggested by timeline<br>
              &gt; &gt; semaphores, i.e. fences being (*addr == val)
              rather than being able to look<br>
              &gt; &gt; at ctx seqno.<br>
              &gt; &gt;<br>
              &gt; &gt; Cheers,<br>
