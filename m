Yes, trying to hook up a peripheral that assumes cache snooping in some
design details to a non coherent SoC may end up exploding in various
ways. On the other hand you can work around most of those assumptions
by marking the memory as uncached to the CPU, which may tank
performance, but will work from a correctness PoV.

Coherent can mean 2 different things:
1. CPU cached with snooping from the IO device
2. CPU uncached

The Vulkan and GL "coherent" uses are really coherent without explicit
domain transitions, so on non coherent arches that require the
transitions the only way to implement this is by making the memory CPU
uncached. Which from a performance PoV will probably not be what app
developers expect, but will still expose the correct behavior.

The DMA_BUF_IOCTL_SYNC is available in upstream, with the explicit
documentation that "userspace can not rely on coherent access".

That only turns up the lines in DMA_BUF_IOCTL_SYNC doc, which are
saying the exact opposite of the DMA-buf is always coherent.

I also don't see why you think that both world views are so totally
different. We could just require explicit domain transitions for non-
snoop access, which would probably solve your scanout issue and would
not be a problem for most ARM systems, where we could no-op this if the
buffer is already in uncached memory and at the same time keep the "x86
assumes cached + snooped access by default" semantics.
