We do update the pid/name for fds passed over unix sockets.

Lsof is quite inefficient for this use case. It has to open _all_ open 
files for _all_ processes on the system to find a handful of ones which 
may have the DRM device open.

For what use case?

To enable GPU usage in top we can do much better than iterate over all 
open files in the system. We can start with a process if going with the 
/proc proposal, or with the opened DRM file directly with the sysfs 
proposal. Both are significantly fewer than total number of open files 
across all processes.
