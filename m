Perhaps these would make doing allmodconfig builds with clang more
frequently less painful for you?

Thanks!

Cc'ing linux-toolchains. The start of the thread is here:

https://lore.kernel.org/CAHk-=wgSqpdkeJBb92M37JNTdRQJRnRUApraHKE8uGHTqQuu2Q@mail.gmail.com/

The problematic function before the fix is here:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/gpu/host1x/dev.c?id=3d3699bde4b043eea17993e4e76804a8128f0fdb#n487

I will see if I have some cycles to try and reduce something out for the
GCC folks.

Cheers,
Nathan
