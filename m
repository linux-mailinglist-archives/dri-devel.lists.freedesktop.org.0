With AUO T215HVN01 panel, connected to LT9211 DSI-to-LVDS bridge, 
connected to MX8M Mini DSIM , the panel just would not come up correctly 
because this unprepare_time is not observed. The panel would only show 
blue stripe on the left side, instead of actual image.

You cannot guarantee in which state the panel is after boot/reboot , so 
I believe the kernel has to shut it down, and then bring it up, with the 
correct timings.

Bootloader does not touch the panel at all.

Partly.

I believe the better approach would be to fix this such that we do not 
operate panels out of specification right now, since panel vendors are 
very sensitive about that, and any sort of optimization is a topic for 
separate patch.

But please do keep in mind that depending on the state of the system in 
which bootloader left it is likely a bad idea.

This is dangerous, since the panel has power sequencing requirements 
which must be observed, i.e. which supplies get flipped on in specific 
order with various delays between each step. That very much rules out 
any such regulator-boot-on shenanigans.
