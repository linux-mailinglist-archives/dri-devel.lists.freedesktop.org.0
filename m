Right, so the thing is Rust can encode *some* borrowed reference 
semantics at compile time, namely what Rust lifetimes can represent. But 
you can't encode arbitrarily complex "I can guarantee this is alive 
right now because reasons A,B,C,D" semantics in the type system. For 
arbitrarily complex rules like that, you need to either refcount, or use 
unsafe and raw pointers. For example, in my driver I use raw pointers in 
the event slot acquisition to point to the actual u32s that hold the 
event values, because I can guarantee through the semantics of that 
module that those will always be valid pointers to the live array (and 
never alias too), even though I can't encode that in the type system. 
Throwing around refcounted pointers to the whole object there would be 
silly, so instead I just used unsafe and left a SAFETY comment 
explaining why it's safe.

In the end, unsafe isn't any worse than C (it's strictly better, you 
still get the borrow checker and type safety and everything else), so I 
don't think Rust not being able to solve all of these problems is really 
a good argument against Rust. The idea, and where Rust really shines, is 
that even when you have to do this you are *containing* the unsafe code 
within places where it can be audited and explained. And when the 
majority of the code is safe, and when you strive to make the interfaces 
between modules safe, and when you limit the ability of cross-module 
interactions to break safety (Not eliminate! In abstractions yes, and in 
userspace Rust this is expected, but within a driver it gets more 
interesting and I can spend a long time talking about how safety 
boundaries in drivers are complicated and a bit porous...) you end up 
reducing the chances of safety bugs by orders of magnitude anyway.

And it worked, right? I have ~128 unsafe{} blocks in the driver and 
still no oopses in production ^^

But (big but!) the idea with safe Rust abstractions (the stuff in rust/) 
is that they absolutely do need to be safe (unless marked unsafe, but 
that sucks...), because then implicitly you are documenting the 
safety/lifetime requirements in the type system and that's hugely 
beneficial for common code. It means users of those APIs don't have to 
think about the internals and safety invariants and all that. Drivers 
still have to worry about internal safety, but they don't have to worry 
about messing up the interface with common code. That's also very 
beneficial for allowing refactoring of that common code without worrying 
that you'll break users.

So technically we could just give up and mark the drm_sched abstraction 
unsafe and actually document all of these safety requirements (which is 
the other side of the coin - if you want to use unsafe, you get to write 
the docs, lawyer style! That's the rule! No getting by with vague docs 
with dozens of unexplained corner cases!). But, honestly, I think that 
would be kind of sad... drm_sched really should have a self-contained, 
safe API, and I just don't see a good reason why it can't other than it 
not having been designed with this in mind initially. It was ported out 
of a driver, and not that long ago, right? That explains a lot, because 
it means it is probably leaking all of these assumptions from that 
driver's internal design... and it probably doesn't help that the people 
maintaining it all seem to be from that particular company either. It's 
easy to have tunnel vision if you mostly work on one use case...

For the specific case of crash dumps and stop-the-world stuff like 
that... yeah, those are some of the worst things to fit in otherwise 
nice Rust designs because they violate layering left and right. I don't 
have a good answer for how exactly I'd do this in my driver yet. I'm 
sure it *can* be done, and there's always unsafe if needed, since at 
that point you're dealing in driver code and that's a lot less 
contentious than an abstraction being unsafe itself...

My initial plan for FW crash dumps is going to be fairly easy because I 
only really care about dumping the firmware object arena and maybe 
actual firmware .data, and that's all GPU-global anyway, and it won't be 
hard to poke my way into the global allocators to take a snapshot of 
their backing GEM objects. There's a global alloc lock involved there 
which is all I need for basic consistency and getting the locking right 
for allocs as far as deadlock risk is something I need to care about for 
other reasons anyway. It won't guarantee that nobody else is *writing* 
to any of that memory while I take a snapshot, but I don't really care 
about that since it would be rare and should be limited to 
newly-allocated memory the firmware doesn't yet care about anyway.

In the end, nothing stops you from having piles of raw pointer 
backdoors, having a rule that "this is only used for the crash handler", 
and then having a couple pages of SAFETY comments in that bit of the 
code with a big "here be dragons" disclaimer. It won't make that 
particular chunk of code any less likely to have bugs than the 
equivalent C code, but at least the rest of the driver isn't affected, 
and hopefully you can at least avoid unsafe in some subsets of the 
troublesome part too ^^

There's also a flipside to this though: Who cares if you take extra 
redundant GEM BO references in the crash handler due to API safety? 
After all, it's not a perf-sensitive codepath. Of course, if safety 
causes you to add refcounting at all where none would otherwise be 
needed, or to have to do more of it in hot paths, or to introduce extra 
locking that could cause deadlocks that's a different story. But I think 
the thought process is very different between Rust and C here, when 
writing drivers. In C, it takes extra work to be safe, so chances are 
most people won't write defensive code like that even where there is no 
performance reason not to, since it's outright easier to read code the 
less safe it is. Rust isn't like that! Most safety is encoded in types 
(automatic reference counting is a big one here), so it doesn't take any 
extra effort to be safe, while it usually does to do it unsafely (unsafe 
{} blocks if nothing else). So then you write safe code by default... 
which yes, might do some extra refcounting and locking and stuff, but 
you can always optimize that later, profiler in hand. Once you know you 
need unsafe for real perf reasons, by all means, and I expect to end up 
doing a round of profiling in the future and have to poke some holes in 
things too. But until then... safe is just easier and, well, safer!

Yeah, that's one I've run into, it's why I have a few places with subtle 
code to avoid that and more things will need cleaning up too...

This is something that I expect will become Rust compile-time magic in 
the future though! There's already been talk about being able to prove 
that things are only ever called from the right execution context. Then 
if you have a Drop of a reference whose underlying type is not safe to 
Drop from IRQ context in IRQ context, the compiler complains. It's not 
clear exactly what this will look like yet, but it's an active topic of 
discussion. And that's another nice thing about Rust: we can actually 
help drive the evolution of the language, much faster than with C!

Yup! ^^

drivers/gpu/drm/asahi$ grep -r core::mem::drop | wc -l
17

Rust is magic but it won't magically solve all of our problems!

(I don't think all of those 17 are necessary, some are just places where 
I wanted to be explicit/safer or bound critical sections more, but a few 
are definitely there to avoid deadlocks.)

Simple Arc<Mutex<T>> usage isn't a problem though, you can't drop the 
refcount without dropping the guard first there (lifetimes prevent it). 
The tricky bit is when you have to call into *another* agent that owns a 
reference to the same object, after having done something while holding 
the mutex. Then you really need to drop the guard first.

It's already been fun and I don't expect it to get any less fun ^^
