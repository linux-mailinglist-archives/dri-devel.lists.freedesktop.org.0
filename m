Hi,

please consider applying the patches chained to this message. It's the
fifth version of the driver for the ENE KB3930 Embedded Controller.

This version is essentially a resend of v4. The only actual change is the
addition of the Rob's Reviewed-by tag which I failed to do previously.
Detailed change logs are in the individual patch descriptions.

Thanks,
Lubo
