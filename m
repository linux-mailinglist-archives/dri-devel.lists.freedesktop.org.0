We exposed this as 'power1_max' previously. However this is a "power
limit".

https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/hwmon/sysfs-interface.rst

says power1_max is "Maximum power". On the other hand, power1_cap is "If
power use rises above this limit, the system should take action to reduce
power use". So it would seem we should have chosen power1_cap for this
power limit instead of power1_max? So do you think we should change this to
power1_cap instead? Though even power1_max has an associated alarm so it
also seems to be a sort of limit.

Is there any guidance as to how these different power limits should be
used? Generally speaking is: power1_max <= power1_cap <= power1_crit, or is
it arbitrary or something else?

Also, only power1_cap seems to have power1_cap_min and power1_cap_max (in
case we wanted to use min/max values for the limits), not the others.

Separately, we have already used up power1_crit (which is the other limit
in official hwmon power limits) so we can't use that.

Thanks.
