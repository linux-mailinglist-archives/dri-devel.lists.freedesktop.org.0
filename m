The Panfrost DRM interface to user space is uesd in Mesa for targets
other than C/Linux. Specifically the header file needs to compile in C++
code and for FreeBSD which shares the same UABI.

The first patch fixes the C++ compilation issue by removing the
(unnecessary) type name from internal structs which is invalid in C++.

The second patch technically changes the UABI by changing the header
values in the dump format to be native endian rather than fixed
little-endian. Since (a) there are no known big-endian Mali systems, and
(b) this has only appeared in -rc1, this shouldn't break user space.
Tools can use the 'magic' field to identify the endianness of the dump
if they want to support big-endian.

This is effectively a 'v2' of Adri√°n's series here [1].
