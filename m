As far as I know wake_up_state() tries to run the thread on the CPU it 
was scheduled last, while wait_event_* makes the thread run on the CPU 
who issues the wake by default.

And yes I've also noticed this already and it was one of the reason why 
I suggested to use a wait_queue instead of the hand wired dma_fence_wait 
implementation.

Well it would have been nicer if we used the existing infrastructure 
instead of re-inventing stuff for dma_fence, but that chance is long gone.

And you don't need a dma_fence_context base class, but rather just a 
flag in the dma_fence_ops if you want to change the behavior.

Christian.
