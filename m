This reverts commit a19b31f854a8992dfa35255f43efd19be292b15c which is
commit a40c5d727b8111b5db424a1e43e14a1dcce1e77f upstream.

The upstream commit a40c5d727b8111b5db424a1e43e14a1dcce1e77f ("drm/dp:
Change AUX DPCD probe address from DPCD_REV to LANE0_1_STATUS") the
reverted commit backported causes a regression, on one eDP panel at
least resulting in display flickering, described in detail at the Link:
below. The issue fixed by the upstream commit will need a different
solution, revert the backport for now.
