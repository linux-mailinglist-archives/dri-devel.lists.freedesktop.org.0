This is exactly the kind of reason why I wanted to get more DRM maintainers
looking at these patches :).

So - the main reason for having old_state/new_state was because in the talk=
s
that I had with Sima, they established that we want to try to avoid
fallibility in callbacks like atomic_check in spots where it doesn't
particularly make sense. Consider for instance: If we're in the atomic_chec=
k
callback for a CRTC then we already know that both it's old state and new
state are present in the atomic state, and which DriverCrtc implementation
they use - so, it's a bit silly for code to have to treat that as fallible.=
 I
had decided on going with passing new_state/old_state to fix this problem, =
but
mainly because I didn't realize that not having these arguments in callback=
s
on the C side of things was intentional.

This being said I think there's a better solution we can do which Sima had
suggested - introducing a type of token for callbacks like this that can
infallibly give access to the old/new state if needed. The basic idea being
that such a token would be proof that:

 * We know that both the old and new atomic state for the CRTC are present =
in
   the current atomic state
 * We know their DriverCrtc and DriverCrtcState implementation

At some point I thought I came to the conclusion this couldn't work for som=
e
reason. But, I just wrote up some code to try it and it seems like this
actually works perfectly with rvkms:

    /// A token provided during [`atomic_check`] callbacks for accessing th=
e crtc, atomic state, and new
    /// and old states of the crtc.
    ///
    /// # Invariants
    ///
    /// This token is proof that the old and new atomic state of `crtc` are=
 present in `state` and do
    /// not have any mutators taken out.
    ///
    /// [`atomic_check`]: DriverCrtc::atomic_check
    pub struct CrtcAtomicCheck<'a, 'b, T: DriverCrtc> {

    }
    =E2=80=8B

        /// Create a new [`CrtcAtomicCheck`] token.

            unsafe { new.unwrap_unchecked() }
        }
    }

So - would replacing (crtc, state, old_state, new_state) with this token be=
 an acceptable replacement?
