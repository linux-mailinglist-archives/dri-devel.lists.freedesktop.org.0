AFAIU, you kind of need to be able to pin buffers and export them to other devices for that whole thing to work, right? If the user doesn't explicitly set a min value, wouldn't the value being zero mean any pins will be rejected (and thus PRIME would break)?

As long as the total amount of pinned memory stays below min, no pinned buffers should get evicted with that either.
That would be setting an eviction priority, that can be done but that gives no guarantee memory will not be evicted.

Kind regards,
