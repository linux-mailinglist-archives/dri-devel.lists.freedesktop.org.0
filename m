Please do, I basically agree with John and Daniele error capture may 
fail under memory pressure, but I couldn't see how we could avoid that 
short of exposing us to dma-fence deadlocks.

I figure basically we'd have to pin all vmas, reset, retire the request 
and *then* do the allocating parts of the capture.

I'll ping Daniel about the best course of action meanwhile for the above 
series.
