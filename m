Regarding unit testing (and KUnit is a unit testing framework), the core
principle is that individual components of the code should be tested in
isolation to validate that they perform as expected.

The "units" should be tested independently and we use those mocks to
simulate dependencies, ensuring that the test focuses solely on the unit
under scrutiny.

If we introduce more things into the mock, we end up losing the
isolation. The mock scheduler, from what I understand, is not suppose to
be a reference design or even something close to a driver.  It should
remain just a mock, a minimal interface to test the scheduler's
internals.

Best Regards,
- MaÃ­ra
