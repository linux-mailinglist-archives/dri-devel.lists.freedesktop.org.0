Could you point out any remaining issues so we can fix them? Right now 
this absolutely *is* broken and this fixes the breakage I observed. If 
there are other bugs remaining, I'd like to know what they are so I can 
fix them.

> The real issue is that the hw fence is kept around much longer than that.

As far as I know, the whole point of scheduler fences is to decouple the 
hw fences from the consumers. I already talked with Daniel about this. 
The current behavior is broken. These fences can live forever. It is 
broken to require that they outlive the driver that produced them.

Did you read my explanation on the cover letter as to how this is just 
broken right now? We need to fix this. If you have a better suggestion 
I'll take it. Doing nothing is not an option.
