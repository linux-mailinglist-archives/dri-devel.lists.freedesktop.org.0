Ok, then we are pretty much already on the same page here.

I've just reverted the patch because I thought it would be cleaner for 
eventually backporting it.

Ah, good point.

I was not talking about bound/unbound, but rather unpopulating before 
destroying.

The requirement we have is that the tt object is unpopulated before it 
is destroyed and the state machine of that object is essentially 
controlled by its BO and not the object itself.

I will prepare a patch making that cleaner.

Thanks,
Christian.
