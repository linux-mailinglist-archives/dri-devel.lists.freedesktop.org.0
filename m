Personally, I don't think it's super useful in the commit message, it still
remains in the patches sent to the mailing list though. And since we put lore
links everywhere, it's easily accessible, *including* the context of why a
change was made from one version to another, i.e. the full conversation.

However, if we really want that, we should make it an offical thing, since
currently the kernel's process documentation [1] clearly states otherwise:

"Please put this information after the '---' line which separates the changelog
from the rest of the patch. The version information is not part of the changelog
which gets committed to the git tree. It is additional information for the
reviewers. If it's placed above the commit tags, it needs manual interaction to
remove it."

Alternatively, it can go into the cover letter.
