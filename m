Hmm, so this was a recent change, moving away from FLUSH_MEM/FLUSH_PT. I
have to admit the spec implies that it a FLUSH_CACHES command wouldn't
set the AS_ACTIVE bit.

Indeed we now actually split the active bit between AS_ACTIVE_EXT and
AS_ACTIVE_INT - where _INT is from an "internal source" and therefore
doesn't prevent writing to the COMMAND register.

We do, however, need the LOCK command to have completed before we flush
the caches. So the operations should be:

 * wait_ready()
 * LOCK
 * wait_ready() // To check that the LOCK has completed
 * FLUSH_CACHES
 * UNLOCK
 * wait_ready() // Optional

The final wait_ready() is optional in some cases (because the LOCK
ensures that we can't have any translations using the old TLB entries -
note that I believe older Midgard GPUs couldn't rely on this). However
in the case where we want to disable a MMU we're going to have to wait.

Note that wait_ready() is really cheap - it's a single GPU register read
if there's nothing active. So the "double wait" isn't really a problem.
I'd much rather have the occasional double wait (i.e. one extra register
read) than the situation where we miss a wait_ready() and end up with an
MMU command being dropped by the hardware.

Thanks,
Steve
