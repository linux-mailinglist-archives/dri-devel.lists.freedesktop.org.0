This reverts 26b1d3b527e7 ("drm/atomic: Take the atomic toys away from
X"), a rootkit-like kludge that has no business being inside of a
general purpose kernel. It's the type of debugging hack I'll use
momentarily but never commit, or a sort of babbies-first-process-hider
malware trick.

The backstory is that some userspace code -- xorg-server -- has a
modesetting DDX that isn't really coded right. With nobody wanting to
maintain X11 anymore, rather than fixing the buggy code, the kernel was
adjusted to avoid having to touch X11. A bummer, but fair enough: if the
kernel doesn't want to support some userspace API any more, the right
thing to do is to arrange for a graceful fallback where userspace thinks
it's not available in a manageable way.

However, the *way* it goes about doing that is just to check
`current->comm[0] == 'X'`, and disable it for only that case. So that
means it's *not* simply a matter of the kernel not wanting to support a
particular userspace API anymore, but rather it's the kernel not wanting
to support xorg-server, in theory, but actually, it turns out, that's
all processes that begin with 'X'.

Playing games with current->comm like this is obviously wrong, and it's
pretty shocking that this ever got committed.

Fortunately, since this was committed, somebody did actually disable
the userspace side by default in X11:
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/-/merge_requests/180 and
this was three years ago. So userspace is mostly fine now for ordinary
default usage. And people who opt into this -- since it does actually
work fine for many use cases on i915 -- ostensibly know what they're
getting themselves into (my case).

So let's just revert this `comm[0] == 'X'` business entirely, but still
allow for `value == 2`, in case anybody actually started working on that
part elsewhere.
