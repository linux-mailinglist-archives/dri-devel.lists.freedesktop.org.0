The idea was to call gem_set_domain on the object to validate the pages
after creation. I only did that for read-only... I did however make mesa
use set-domain for validation.

As a question how are you getting to call userptr on something that
wasn't passed by SHM ipc?

That should be a non-sequitur; certainly VT switch works without ever
using the GPU.

See https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/series/33449/ for adding PROBE |
POPULATE flags.

But we can just use set-domain.
