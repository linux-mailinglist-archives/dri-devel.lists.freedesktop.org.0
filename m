As part of enabling GuC submission discussed in [1], [2], and [3] we
need optimize and update the CT code as this is now in the critical
path of submission. This series includes the patches to do that which is
the first 7 patches from [3]. The patches should have addressed all the
feedback in [3] and should be ready to merge once CI returns a we get a
few more RBs.

v2: Fix checkpatch warning, address a couple of Michal's comments
v3: Address John Harrison's comments
