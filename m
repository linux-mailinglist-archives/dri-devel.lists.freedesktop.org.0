Ernest mentioned in v2[3] that when pdata->bridge.type is not
set, the type field is 0 causing issue for eDP when enable_comms
is called before auxiliary_driver probe.

So it should be okay to check the bridge type for
DRM_MODE_CONNECTOR_Unknown (0) OR DRM_MODE_CONNECTOR_eDP (14) and
disable HPD in both case?
Or equivalently using !(DRM_MODE_CONNECTOR_DisplayPort) as this bridge
would support only these 2 connector types???

Then for DP case, it should behave like you mentioned: First disabling
HPD till types is set in auxiliary_driver probe. And once set to 10,
(for DRM_MODE_CONNECTOR_DisplayPort) enabling it for DisplayPort
connector type.
