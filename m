Refcounting everywhere has been working well for us, so well that so far 
all the oopses we've hit have been... drm_sched bugs like this one, not 
anything in the driver. But at least in Rust you have the advantage that 
you can't just forget a decref in a rarely-hit error path (or worse, 
forget an incref somewhere important)... ^^

Is this really a thing? I think that's never going to work well for 
explicit sync, since the kernel doesn't even know what BOs it has to 
keep alive for a job... I guess it could keep the entire file and all of 
its objects/VMs/etc alive until all of its submissions complete but... ewww.

Our Mesa implementation synchronously waits for all jobs on context 
destroy for this reason, but if you just kill the app, yeah, you get 
faults as running GPU jobs have BOs yanked out from under them. Kill 
loops make for a good way of testing fault handling...
