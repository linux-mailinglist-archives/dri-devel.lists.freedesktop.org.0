Hmm, interesting. You are correct - I knew that it is possible to do an
UNLOCK without a LOCK and in that case it is the UNLOCK which performs
the invalidation. But looking back through the architecture
documentation it does actually state that the LOCK invalidates MMU
caches. So it appears I'm wrong - sorry about that.

Well before this series there are a total of two functions currently
which have the mmu_hw_ prefix:
 * mmu_hw_do_operation_locked
 * mmu_hw_do_operation

Which I think needed something more than "do_operation", possibly
"do_mmu_operation" or "do_mmu_hw_operation" might have been better, but
I don't think there's a great difference. Generally we don't include a
prefix on static functions because they are local to the file.

It's interesting that the documentation says:

So while I can't deny that the command is called "LOCK", informally we
do call it "lock region" more commonly because it describes the purpose
better.
