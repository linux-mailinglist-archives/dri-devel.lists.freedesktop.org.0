The above is a broken drm driver, because shutting down something that the
main drm driver needs _before_ it is shut down itself is broken. That's
why we need the device link.

So if this case goes a bit wrong that's imo ok. That was my point that
without device links, we cannot have _any_ warning at all, but we can at
least make sure that correct drivers, meaning:
- they make sure the panel is around for longer than the drm device
- and they call drm atomic_helper_shutdown in the right places

Wont either double-shutdown the panel or get the warning.

It's not great, but it's at least better than the current situation where
correct drivers get a warning, and some broken drivers don't. So still an
improvement.

That leaves us with the issue of warning for all broken drivers. We have
two proposals for that:

- Your explicit list, which is a pain imo, and I'm not seeing the benefit
  of this, because it'll encourage each driver to hack around the core
  code bug of not having the right device links.

- Fixing this with a device link and adding the warning for everyone.

This isn't a great situation, because it's likely going to be another few
years without the device link situation sorted out. But that's been the
case already for years so *shrug*.

Yeah, but your warning I think just encourages more hacks in drivers that
shouldn't be there (for the ordering issue). So I'm not sure it's strictly
better.

And we have _tons_ of drm driver api misuse that we don't catch with
warnings and checks. Sometimes that's just not possible, because the
situation is too messy. If we add an explicit "I'm not broken" list for
each such case, we will have an unmaintainable mess. Sometimes a "I'm the
last broken driver" flag makes sense, but even there I'm cautious that
it's a bright idea.

Cheers, Sima
