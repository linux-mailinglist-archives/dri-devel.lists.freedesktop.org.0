--- Comment #5 from Erik Huelsmann (ehuels@gmail.com) ---
Is the fact that it's apparently not possible to switch the memory clock with 2
monitors attached a design error in the hardware? Unfortunately, I don't have
the Windows setup anymore to investigate it.
I'm extremely happy with my 'radeon.dpm=0' setup, because I'm only doing
text-editing, programming and web browsing.

As I understand it, it's a choice where you have to run a high clock
continually or cause possible on-screen glitches? That's too bad. I personally
wouldn't mind a small flicker if that would help the noise of my laptop, but I
do understand others may make other choices here.
