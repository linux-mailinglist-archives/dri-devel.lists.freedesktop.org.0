This patchset makes dma-buf exporters responisble for taking care of
the reservation lock. I also included patch that moves drm-shmem to use
reservation lock, to let CI test the whole set. I'm going to take all
the patches via the drm-misc tree, please give an ack.

Previous policy stated that dma-buf core takes the lock around mmap()
callback. Which meant that both importers and exporters shouldn't touch
the reservation lock in the mmap() code path. This worked well until
Intel-CI found a deadlock problem in a case of self-imported dma-buf [1].

The problem happens when userpace mmaps a self-imported dma-buf, i.e.
mmaps the dma-buf FD. DRM core treats self-imported dma-bufs as own GEMs
[2]. There is no way to differentiate a prime GEM from a normal GEM for
drm-shmem in drm_gem_shmem_mmap(), which resulted in a deadlock problem
for drm-shmem mmap() code path once it's switched to use reservation lock.

It was difficult to fix the drm-shmem problem without adjusting dma-buf
locking policy. In parctice not much changed from importers perspective
because previosly dma-buf was taking the lock in between of importers
and exporters. Now this lock is shifted down to exporters.

Changelog:

v2: - Added ack from Christian König to the DRM patch.

    - Dropped "fixes" tag from the patches, like was requested by
      Christian König. The patches don't actually need a backport
      and merely improve the locking policy.

    - Dropped "reverts" from the patch titles to prevent them from
      auto-backporting by the stable bot based on the title.

    - Added r-b from Emil Velikov and placed the drm_WARN in the
      drm-shmem patch like he suggested in a comment to v1.

    - Corrected drm-shmem patch dma_resv_lock(obj->resv) inconsistently
      used with dma_resv_unlock(shmem->base.resv). Now shmem->base.resv
      variant is used for all locks/unlocks.
