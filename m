Hello,

This is a submission for Xe, a new driver for Intel GPUs that supports both
integrated and discrete platforms starting with Tiger Lake (first platform with
Intel Xe Architecture). The intention of this new driver is to have a fresh base
to work from that is unencumbered by older platforms, whilst also taking the
opportunity to rearchitect our driver to increase sharing across the drm
subsystem, both leveraging and allowing us to contribute more towards other
shared components like TTM and drm/scheduler. The memory model is based on VM
bind which is similar to the i915 implementation. Likewise the execbuf
implementation for Xe is very similar to execbuf3 in the i915 [1].

The code is at a stage where it is already functional and has experimental
support for multiple platforms starting from Tiger Lake, with initial support
implemented in Mesa (for Iris and Anv, our OpenGL and Vulkan drivers), as well
as in NEO (for OpenCL and Level0). A Mesa MR has been posted [2] and NEO
implementation will be released publicly early next year. We also have a suite
of IGTs for XE that will appear on the IGT list shortly.

It has been built with the assumption of supporting multiple architectures from
the get-go, right now with tests running both on X86 and ARM hosts. And we
intend to continue working on it and improving on it as part of the kernel
community upstream.

The new Xe driver leverages a lot from i915 and work on i915 continues as we
ready Xe for production throughout 2023.

As for display, the intent is to share the display code with the i915 driver so
that there is maximum reuse there. Currently this is being done by compiling the
display code twice, but alternatives to that are under consideration and we want
to have more discussion on what the best final solution will look like over the
next few months. Right now, work is ongoing in refactoring the display codebase
to remove as much as possible any unnecessary dependencies on i915 specific data
structures there..

We currently have 2 submission backends, execlists and GuC. The execlist is
meant mostly for testing and is not fully functional while GuC backend is fully
functional. As with the i915 and GuC submission, in Xe the GuC firmware is
required and should be placed in /lib/firmware/xe.

The GuC firmware can be found in the below location:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git/tree/i915

The easiest way to setup firmware is:
cp -r /lib/firmware/i915 /lib/firmware/xe

The code has been organized such that we have all patches that touch areas
outside of drm/xe first for review, and then the actual new driver in a separate
commit. The code which is outside of drm/xe is included in this RFC while
drm/xe is not due to the size of the commit. The drm/xe is code is available in
a public repo listed below.

Xe driver commit:
https://cgit.freedesktop.org/drm/drm-xe/commit/?h=drm-xe-next&id=9cb016ebbb6a275f57b1cb512b95d5a842391ad7

Xe kernel repo:
https://cgit.freedesktop.org/drm/drm-xe/

There's a lot of work still to happen on Xe but we're very excited about it and
wanted to share it early and welcome feedback and discussion.

Cheers,
Matthew Brost
