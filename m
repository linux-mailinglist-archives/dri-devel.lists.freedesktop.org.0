In the case of st7703 driver, yes tested, and proper shutdown of the panel is
necessary, because lack of it can lead to otherwise inexplainable blinking of
the entire screen, when the panel is quickly powered up and re-initialized again
(eg. as happens when bootloader has display support). Blinking then only ever
stops if the panel is left completely powered off for several minutes.

There's a note about this in the controller datasheet, that proper power off
is needed to enable dicharge of the panel.

Kind regards,
