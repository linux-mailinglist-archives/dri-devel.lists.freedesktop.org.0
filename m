I agree that the description of this specific tag is not useful by itself.

But at least it means: should it be backported, it can be done up to 
there. (and sometimes LWN gives some statistics on how long it took to 
fix an "issue", should it be considered as such)

Without it, it is not easy to guess in which branch the patch is meaningful.

I'll sent a v2 with your suggested minimal change, but I'll keep the 
Fixes tag.


Up to you to remove it or not, and to add a <stable@kernel.org> or a 
<stable+noautosel@kernel.org> or none of them.

Any solution is fine with me.

so it really was the one I found on wikipedia, LoL!

So, another way to "fix" the issue is maybe to deprecate the driver or 
everything related to this old architecture?

No strong opinion about it.
