I think what would be interesting is if we had "chatty" member as a
part of mipi_dsi_multi_context as a check for if dev_err should run.
That way, we could make any function not chatty. If we did this, is
there any reason for a driver to not switch over to using the multi
functions?

The problem with any macro solution that defines new multi functions is 
that it creates a lot of bloat. Defining the function through macros
might be smaller than defining them manually, but there are still twice
as many function declarations as there would be if we went all multi. 
The generated code is still just as big as if we manually defined
everything. I think a macro that defines functions should be more of a 
last resort if we don't have any other options.
