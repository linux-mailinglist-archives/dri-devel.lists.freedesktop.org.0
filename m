EGL_IMG_context_priority and VK_KHR_global_priority. But both are just 
hints and definitely do not prescribe or require SCHED_FIFO like behaviour.

Yes exactly. I don't think DRM scheduler _needs_ to be like SCHED_FIFO. 
More like SCHED_OTHER would I think work better if we were to (finally) 
expose some external control (see 
https://blogs.igalia.com/tursulin/drm-scheduling-cgroup-controller/ for 
one related example).
