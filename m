Yes I really hope we can find a way to get this accepted.

Parsing text files in the kernel sounds very scary, not something that I
would like to try.

I will make a script that generates and parses the binary representation
(which is big endian so it's somewhat readable with xxd or the like).
There's a wiki link in the MAINTAINERS entry that will have info about
the format including the script. It will also serve as a place to share
config snippets/script incantations for displays.

I will make the script when the file format is decided upon. Here's the
hack I currently use:
