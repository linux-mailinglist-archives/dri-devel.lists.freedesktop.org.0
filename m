That something along those lines might be a concern was indeed worrying 
me when coming up with the scheme. Good inside knowledge hint, thank 
you. I will have a deeper look.

Correct. So far that was handled outside the cgroup controller in the 
drm layer and any lock dependency propagation was hidden behind RCU.
But that will likely change once I try your suggestion of eliminating 
the struct pid based client tracking and so become relevant.

Thanks, I will look into this all hopefully shortly. Perhaps what you 
suggest will come naturally with the removal of struct pid based tracking.
