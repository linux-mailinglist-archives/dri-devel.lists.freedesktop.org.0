I'll add it to the commit message

The ioctl() returns error if DRM_VIRTGPU_MADVISE unsupported, extra
flags not needed by userspace

We should finish shmem first since started with it, then move to blobs.

My rough idea for the blobs is to use a timer-based approach to avoid
frequent virtio syncing with host that will be bad for performance
otherwise. Virtio-gpu kernel driver will maintain a list of purgeable
blobs and will send the list of idling blobs down to host after a period
of inactivity.

Virgl may be not interesting for CrOS, but Qemu will continue supporting
it. I also expect that today's ARM Chromebooks which use Virgl and only
support GL will continue to use Virgl for the next 4 years.

Are you talking about killing a guest APP that uses host blobs when host
is under pressure? I'm not familiar with how arcvm works, but may assume
that it runs a VM per APP. In that case VM is just another process from
the lmkd perspective that will be taken down on OOM, i.e. blob buffers
already should be seen as a part of a VM's memory by lmkd when they
reside in sysmem.
