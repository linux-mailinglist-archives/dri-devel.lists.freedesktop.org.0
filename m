The core bits + the bits that affect amdgpu are reviewed. But I think it's
still waiting on review from maintainers of the other drivers the patch
impacts. I wouldn't expect it to land before 5.3 or even 5.4 at the earliest
unfortunately.

I would still need to debug to know for sure if that's the actual bug that's
going on here but it seems likely given that it's atomic DC + cursor moveme=
nt +
xf86-video-amdgpu that's causing the issue.
