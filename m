I don't have objections on changing this description but for reference 
gen12 version of the same says "The main surface is Y-tiled and is at 
plane index 0 whereas CCS is linear and at index 1. The clear color is 
stored at index 2, and the pitch should be ignored.", only plane indexes 
are mentioned. I anyway wrote neither of these descriptions.

I didn't think we needed to go deeper as you started to just talk about 
how drm_mode_fb_cmd2::offsets[1] not being used. Let's not waste time.

But it need to defined as part of the modifier. It's the modifier 
features which are being described here.

Generally answer is yes but these parts you can see in patch "[PATCH v5 
17/19] drm/i915/dg2: Flat CCS Support" and should be discussed there. 
Here "HW" should probably be changed something meaningful though.
