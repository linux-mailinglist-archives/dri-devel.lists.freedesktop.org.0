You are perhaps quoting the wrong bit here ;-). The currently proposed
patch leaves the code to put the pin into output mode unmodified. However
there was an extra line at the bottom of your commit message:
--
Also: check the current direction and only read the value if it's output.
--

This was the bit I wanted to check on, since the proposed patch
literally reverses this!

However...

... if you're happy the proposed change is OK then I'm happy too!
I came to the same conclusion after reviewing the GPIO code this morning,
however I copied you in because I was worried I might have overlooked
something.

Agreed.
