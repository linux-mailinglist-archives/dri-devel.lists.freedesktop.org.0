--- Comment #30 from Lyude Paul (lyude@redhat.com) ---
Hi! Sorry for the long wait, I got distracted with some other work that needed
to be done. Also, sorry for making you buy that adapter since it looks like
things aren't working still. So I took a look at the logs that you gave me and
noticed some interesting things that didn't catch my eye before. In the last
log you gave me with the new DP adapter I can't see nouveau noticing any of the
monitors. On the log before that though, I actually see it detect all four
monitors. I also see it actually turn all four on successfully, huh.

The other thing I noticed is that it looks like you're using the nouveau DDX in
your X config. That makes me wonder, do the screens come up -at all- during the
boot process before the GUI comes up? As well, have you tried the modesetting
DDX to see if that makes any difference, or perhaps wayland?
