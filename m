I'm fine to scratch mine as long as the issue gets fixed :)

FWIW, the biggest problem so far was the aux channel backlight didn't
work as expected, the actual backlight isn't changed by the backlight
sysfs write.  (And the sysfs read gives a bogus value, but it's not
the cause of the non-working backlight control.)

Does the aux channel backlight really work with the current code?
Or is this rather a device-specific issue (e.g. broken BIOS) and we
might need to come up with a deny list or such?


thanks,

Takashi
