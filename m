There are many CI patches merged recently to drm-misc-next.
With the GitLab 18.0 release, CI/CD pipeline configurations must 
transition from using the deprecated CI_JOB_JWT to the new id_tokens 
method, as the former will be removed.

Without the below commit kernel-build job pipelines fail in drm-ci,
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/misc/kernel/-/commit/cc806b74466672a9bbd4e9a04265d44eb506b686

We need to cherry pick only this commit to fix this issue.
So it would be beneficial to have a drm-ci-next branch.

Regards,
Vignesh
