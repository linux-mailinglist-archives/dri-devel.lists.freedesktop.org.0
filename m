--- Comment #79 from deltasquared <ds2.bugs.freedesktop@gmail.com> ---
OK, have managed to get an unrelated crash from starting minetest now with =
the
mentioned patch so at this point I think that case is unrelated. (Certainly
seems to be more subtle, this MT crash has never been as reliable to trigge=
r as
some of the other things on this thread).

Will endeavour to file a bug separately. Any suggestions on information to
kickstart such a related bug would be appreciated, else I will reach out to
various channels on freenode first to get that ball rolling.
