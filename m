FWIW, you in the flood of emails likely missed that this is the same
thread where you yesterday replied "If the module parameter didn't help
then perhaps you are seeing some other issue.  Can you bisect?". That's
why I decided to add this to the tracking. Or am I missing something
obvious here?

/me looks around again and can't see anything, but that doesn't have to
mean anything...

Felix, btw, this guide might help you with the bisection, even if it's
just for kernel compilation:

https://docs.kernel.org/next/admin-guide/quickly-build-trimmed-linux.html

And to indirectly reply to your mail from yesterday[1]. You might want
to ignore the arch linux kernel git repo and just do a bisection between
6.1 and the latest 6.2.y kernel using upstream repos; and if I were you
I'd also try 6.3 or even mainline before that, in case the issue was
fixed already.
