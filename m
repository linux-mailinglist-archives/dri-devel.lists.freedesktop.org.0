Whoops! Usually the way that I keep track of my changelogs is by typing the=
m
in squash! commits, and then leaving them below the patch cutline once I
squash everything. It looks like at some point I mistakenly typed V4: on on=
e
of the squash commits instead of V3: and didn't catch it. So, that comment =
is
definitely for V3 - not V4 which doesn't exist yet
