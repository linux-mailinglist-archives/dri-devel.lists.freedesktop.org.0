Thanks for the reminder, but I tested that already... that doesn't work.

There's one more thing I tried: on the MFG iospace, there are debug registers
that you can poll to check if all bus transactions are finished (so, if the bus
is idle).
During local testing, I even hacked in that, and even with the actual bus being
completely idle, it still freezes... and also checked some more in downstream
code (for Dimensity 9200, kernel 5.10) if there was any other "trick" that I
could make use of, but to no avail.

I'd propose to get at least this power saving upstreamed, then perhaps in the
future we can somehow revisit this to implement some more aggressive power
management code?
We're still getting a generous power saving with this one, I'd say...

Anyway, I expect us to be effectively able to be more aggressive here, but I
also expect that to take quite a bit of time (and probably some help from
MediaTek as well)...
