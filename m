That is how bindings are supposed to be...  However typically the driver
is written/ported first and then the bindings are simply created to
reflect this, and sometimes (as is the case with this patch)
incorrectly.

That, together with a lack of DTS and known-working device with it
(which is why I'm submitting driver+bindings+dts in one series now!)
makes us shoot ourselves in the foot by locking everyone into an ABI
that makes no sense.

Exactly, I hope/doubt anyone was already using these incomplete
bindings.  And again: the ABI here is the name->phandle mapping, the
order Does Not Matterâ„¢.  So I hope we can let it slide (otherwise the
previous patch shouldd have been NAK'ed as well??)

(Unless you are SM6115 which uses index-based mapping and does not
 define clock-names at all)
