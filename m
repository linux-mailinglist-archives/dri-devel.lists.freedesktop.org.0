Well as far as I can see what Daniel and I say here perfectly matches.

When the operation busy waits then that *should* get accounted to the 
CPU time of the current process. When the operation sleeps and waits for 
some interrupt for example it should not get accounted.

What you suggest is to put the parts of the operation which busy wait 
into a background task and then sleep for that task to complete. This is 
not a solution to the problem, but just hides it.

Stuff like that is not a valid justification for the change. Ville 
changes on the other hand tried to prevent lock contention which is a 
valid goal here.

Regards,
Christian.
