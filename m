Sorry for that, I wasn't realizing what you are actually trying to do.

Yeah, exactly that's the reason why you shouldn't mess with this.

In theory you could try to re-program the necessary north bridge blocks 
to make integrated graphics work even if you installed a dedicated VGA 
adapter, but you will most likely be missing something.

The only real fix is to tell the BIOS that you want to use the 
integrated VGA device even if a dedicated one is detected.

If you want to learn more about the background AMD has a bunch of 
documentation around this on their website: 
https://www.amd.com/en/search/documentation/hub.html

The most interesting document for you is probably the BIOS programming 
manual, but don't ask me what exactly the title of that one. @Alex do 
you remember what that was called?

IIRC Intel had similar documentations public, but I don't know where to 
find those of hand.

Regards,
Christian.
