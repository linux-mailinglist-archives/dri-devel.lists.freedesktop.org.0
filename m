Hi,

the IRQ descriptor is allocated with a static node ID of zero. I'm not sure
if that is correct, if it should use the same node as the card itself, or
if it is completely inconsequential.

This came up while trying to find out why the request_irq for the MEI
interrupt fails for me. It doesn't seem to help, but it struck me as a
potential source of problems later on.

   Simon
