--- Comment #158 from ReddestDream <reddestdream@gmail.com> ---
More good news. It seems that 5.3.4 does work for me and doesn't (at least
immediately since I'm typing this from there right now) fall apart into a
glitchy mess.

I'm still not really sure of the complete stability of things tho because w=
e do
still see our old friend: "amdgpu: [powerplay] Failed to send message 0x28,
response 0x0, amdgpu: [powerplay] [SetHardMinFreq] Set hard min uclk failed=
!"
in dmesg. So, AFAICT, there's still something wrong. It's just more stable =
than
it was before.

But yeah. This is the first time since I've gotten this card that I've been
able to boot to a DE w/o crashing and w/o disabling dpm. :)
