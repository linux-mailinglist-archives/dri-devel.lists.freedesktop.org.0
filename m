Have a look at [1]. That main path ends with the DP_INTF0 which is the
eDP output. But from what I understand that path can also use the DSI
output. But that is a pattern for all the paths in that file. Looks like
all supported boards in the kernel will have the output type for a given
SoC/path (or maybe the mt8195 is the first one which supports different
output interfaces).

If you have a look at the mediatek kernel instead [2], there the last
part of the path is not fixed, but there is also a .conn_routes property
by which you seem to be able to choose the actual output interface.

I was just curious if you know of any development for that (or similar)
in the kernel.
