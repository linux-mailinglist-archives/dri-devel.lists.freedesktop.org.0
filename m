Will this manager be able to connect GPU VA mappings to host memory
allocations (aka user pointers) ?

I only skimmed over the uapi definitions, but from that quick glance I
saw you can only pass a (gem) handle to the vm bind uapi.

I think it is an important feature because you don't want to have two
GPU VA managers running in your driver (if that's even possible).
Maybe we should at least try to make sure the uapi is/will be
compatible with such an extension.
