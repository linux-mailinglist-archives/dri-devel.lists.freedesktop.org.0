I retested by adding a print in ti_sn_bridge_detect().
With the HPD_DISABLE bit set the HPD_DEBOUNCED_STATE is always true
resulting in reporting always connected.

When one does not set the HPD_DISABLE bit and is in runtime suspend
(i.e. detect() enables the bridge with its call to
pm_runtime_get_sync() ) then the HPD_DEBOUNCED_STATE is only set
after the debounce time. As it is immediately read here detect()
always reports disconnected.

That is what I wanted to do as nothing else worked ...
Probably there are better solutions.

Correct, it shouldn't. However if the bridge is coming out of
powerup/reset then we have to wait the debounce time time to get the
current state of HPD. The bridge starts with disconnected and only
sets connected after it seen has the HPD pin at '1' for the debounce
time.

Adding a 400ms sleep would fix that.

The HW I use doesn't has the interrupt pin connected. So for me that is
out of scope but should of course work.

If I remove disabling suspend/resume and fix detect() to report the
'correct' HPD state in both runtime pm states I now get another issue
after disconnecting and then reconnecting the monitor:

[   50.035964] ti_sn65dsi86 3-002c: [drm:ti_sn_bridge_atomic_enable [ti_sn65dsi86]] *ERROR* Can't read lane count (-110); assuming 4

monitor stays black without signals.

So it seems the bridges internal state is not completely restored by
the current code. Looking into that now.
