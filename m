This is an attempt to revive the patches posted by Jason Gunthorpe at:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-media/cover/0-v2-472615b3877e+28f7-vfio_dma_buf_jgg@nvidia.com/

Here is the cover letter text from Jason's original series:
"dma-buf has become a way to safely acquire a handle to non-struct page
memory that can still have lifetime controlled by the exporter. Notably
RDMA can now import dma-buf FDs and build them into MRs which allows for
PCI P2P operations. Extend this to allow vfio-pci to export MMIO memory
from PCI device BARs.

This series supports a use case for SPDK where a NVMe device will be owned
by SPDK through VFIO but interacting with a RDMA device. The RDMA device
may directly access the NVMe CMB or directly manipulate the NVMe device's
doorbell using PCI P2P.

However, as a general mechanism, it can support many other scenarios with
VFIO. I imagine this dmabuf approach to be usable by iommufd as well for
generic and safe P2P mappings."

In addition to the SPDK use-case mentioned above, the capability added
in this patch series can also be useful when a buffer (located in device
memory such as VRAM) needs to be shared between any two dGPU devices or
instances (assuming one of them is bound to VFIO PCI) as long as they
are P2P DMA compatible.

The original series has been augmented to include a mmap handler to
provide CPU access to the dmabuf and support for creating the dmabuf
from multiple ranges of a region.

Changelog:

v1 -> v2:
- Rebase on 6.10-rc4
- Update the copyright year in dma_buf.c (Zhu Yanjun)
- Check the revoked flag during mmap() and also revoke the mappings
  as part of move when access to the MMIO space is disabled (Alex)
- Include VM_ALLOW_ANY_UNCACHED and VM_IO flags for mmap (Alex)
- Fix memory leak of ranges when creation of priv fails (Alex)
- Check return value of vfio_device_try_get_registration() (Alex)
- Invoke dma_buf move for runtime PM and FLR cases as well (Alex)
- Add a separate patch to have all the feature functions take
  the core device pointer instead of the main device ptr (Alex)
- Use the regular DMA APIs (that were part of original series) instead
  of PCI P2P DMA APIs while mapping the dma_buf (Jason)
- Rename the region's ranges from p2p_areas to dma_ranges (Jason)
- Add comments in vfio_pci_dma_buf_move() to describe how the locking
  is expected to work (Jason)

This series is available at:
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/Vivek/drm-tip/-/commits/vfio_dmabuf_2

along with additional patches for Qemu and Spice here:
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/Vivek/qemu/-/commits/vfio_dmabuf_2
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/Vivek/spice/-/commits/encode_dmabuf_v8

This series is tested using the following method:
- Run Qemu with the following relevant options:
  qemu-system-x86_64 -m 4096m ....
  -device vfio-pci,host=0000:03:00.0
  -device virtio-vga,max_outputs=1,blob=true,xres=1920,yres=1080
  -spice port=3001,gl=on,disable-ticketing=on,preferred-codec=gstreamer:h264
  -object memory-backend-memfd,id=mem1,size=4096M
  -machine memory-backend=mem1 ...
- Run upstream Weston with the following options in the Guest VM:
  ./weston --drm-device=card1 --additional-devices=card0

where card1 is a DG2 dGPU (assigned to vfio-pci and using xe driver
in Guest VM), card0 is virtio-gpu.
