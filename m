This mentions new drivers ?

Actually, reverting commit 05aa61334592 ("drm: bridge: dw-mipi-dsi: Fix 
enable/disable of DSI controller") makes the STM32MP15xx work again like 
it used to since Linux 5.10 or so, so that commit breaks existing 
working use case.

It seems it is sufficient to revert only this part of the commit to make 
the STM32MP15xx work as it used to, do you have any idea why ?
