Well, that depends. The board actually has an eDP socket, but because we
are an OEM, there might be no display connected to it. (And I haven't
tried it yet). It should probably go into an own device tree or overlay
if it is used. I agree. But it looked like it was auto-detectable (it
even has a HDP pin on the eDP socket, not sure about its use case..)

But the real reason I've enabled it was because I'll get an kernel
oops otherwise. I thought it might be some quirk that you'll need both,
because eDP will register even if theres no display - as you've
mentioned below.

Any help is where to look is appreciated.

Oh with "I don't know why, but to make dp_intf1 work.." I meant the 
splat
above. I figured that dpi won't probe if a dependency is still deferred 
;)
