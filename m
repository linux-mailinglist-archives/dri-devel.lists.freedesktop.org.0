Well now I'm not sure ;) This was based on the implementations of
drm_dev_is_unplugged() and drm_dev_unplug(). drm_dev_is_unplugged()
simply tries to enter then exit. drm_dev_unplug() sets dev->unplugged
(without first taking any locks). So my naÃ¯ve combination resulted in
the above.

The part I was missing is the synchronize_srcu() call in
drm_dev_unplug() is what matches up with the read lock in drm_dev_enter().

I can't figure out how to do this other than adding a new atomic status
bit into panthor. So something like:

	if (!drm_dev_enter())
		/* Already unplugged */
		return;

	if (atomic_cmpxchg(&unplugging, false, true)) {
		/* Racing with another thread */
		drm_dev_exit();
		/* Wait for other threads to exit */
		synchronize_srcu(&drm_unplug_srcu);
		return;
	}

	panthor_xxx_unplug()

	drm_dev_exit();

Or at least I think that might work. The need to synchronize with
drm_unplug_srcu means this really needs a new helper in drm_drv.c.

Yeah, I hadn't really thought through the reader/writer locks.

I quite liked the unplugged approach, it hides the complexities of the
GPU breaking nicely.

However I do think this path needs fixing in some way, because of the
"goto out" we end up calling panthor_device_unplug() while in the
drm_dev_enter() section. Which, unless I'm mistaken, means
panthor_device_unplug() will call drm_dev_unplug() in that section -
which should produce a lockdep warning at the very least, if not an
actual deadlock.

Given it's only a read lock - I think simply moving drm_dev_exit() below
the "out:" label fixes the deadlock without making any races worse.
Whether the race here actually matters I'm not sure.

Yeah, matching kbase is almost certainly the safest approach ;) Sorry, I
was reviewing the patches mostly in order and this looked really odd
until I started digging into it. Zero is clearly not the ideal value,
but the reset value is also just a weird value for hardware validation
(it enables easier checking of the wrap condition). Since kbase picks 1,
that must be a value which works well!

I've no idea if it's actually possible, but it feels like it should be
possible to create a firmware synchronisation object with an error code
chosen by the user and possibly then propagate that error code back to
the kernel. It's certainly not trivial though. Either way the WARN is
unnecessary.

Yeah I didn't bother to check whether it would create ordering issues...
;) I'll leave you to figure out the fix - the whole atomic + mutex was
confusing and doesn't seem to have quite worked.

If the IRQ is shared then Linux doesn't know which device caused the
interrupt, so another device's (shared) interrupt could cause our
handler to be run.

What I'm not following is why we need all this extra infrastructure for
IRQs. The 'setting the mask to 0' during suspend is simple enough and
could be included in code which now calls panthor_xxx_irq_suspend()
(equally for restoring the mask on resume). But there's a loads more
code here.

My initial thought when I looked at this was that you were trying to
solve the issue of a shared IRQ where Mali might get powered off, but
the IRQ is then triggered by another device. In that case touching the
Mali registers would be problematic, so I was expecting some code in
_irq_raw_handler() to check whether the IRQ couldn't possibly be for us
(i.e. mask==0) and early out with IRQ_NONE. kbase has a concept like
this "gpu_powered" for exactly this reason.

But I can't see anything in the code to handle that case. And the
"spamming" of other drivers during suspend shouldn't really happen
(there's something odd going on if the hardware is generating interrupts
when it's meant to be suspended).

But maybe I'm just missing something - it's a while since I've dealt
with interrupt code in Linux.
