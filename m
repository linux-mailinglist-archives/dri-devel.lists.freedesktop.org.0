No, what I mean is that there don't have a device driver for monitor(display) hardware entity.
And the drm_do_probe_ddc_edid() is the static linked driver, which is similar with the idea
this series want to express.

No, this problem can be easily solved. Simply add another argument.

```

int it66121_create_bridge(struct i2c_client *client, bool of_support,
                           bool hpd_support, bool audio_support, u32 bus_width,
                           struct drm_bridge **bridge);
```

This will force all non-DT users to add the similar code patter at the display controller side,
which is another kind of duplication. The monitor is also as I2C slave device, can be abstract
as a identify drm bridges in theory, I guess.

No, leave that chance to a more better programmerÂ and forgive me please,
too difficult, I'm afraid of not able to solve. Thanks a lot for the trust!
