Why? You just add new op to mipi_dsi_host_ops and create appropriate 
helper, which in case of NULL will perform default action, either:
- return -ENOSYS,
- try to emulate by calling mipi_dsi_device_transfer(MIPI_DSI_NULL_PACKET)

The latter is just wild guess, but I suspect it could work (even now) as 
an alternate way of entering into stop state.

LP-11 is quite reasonable, but regarding frequency I am not sure who 
should manage it? DSI device datasheets known to me usually mentioned 
max frequency, and it is covered by mipi_dsi_device.hs_rate. Min 
frequency is usually determined by amount of data we need to transfer 
per second.
Do you need to set frequency from device, or just to know actual frequency?
In former case (if it is really necessary !!!) you should request 
frequency range anyway, as host usually is able to set only discrete 
number of frequencies. But it need to be clearly specified how and when 
this op can be used - more ops, more questions about interaction between 
them.
In latter case another mipi host op should be quite easy to implement.

Another op :)
