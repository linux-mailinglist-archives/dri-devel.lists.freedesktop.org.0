These are all very good points, which call for stricter-than-usual application of the "new UAPI requires corresponding user-space patches" rule:

* Patches adding support for the new modifiers in Mesa (and kernel) drivers for at least two separate vendors
* Patches adding support in at least one non-Mesa user-space component, e.g. a Wayland compositor which has code using the existing linear modifier (e.g. mutter)


Ideally also describe a specific multi-vendor scenario which can't work with the existing linear modifier, and validate that it works with the new ones.
