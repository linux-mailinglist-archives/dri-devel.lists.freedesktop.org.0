With that patch, we can expose a larger screen_size to userspace,

change screen_size to `helper->fb->height * helper->fb->pitches[0]` is *NOT* necessary.


But I though it maybe better to keep it line with the counter part in 
drm_fbdev_dma_helper_fb_probe().

make it double security.

BecauseÂ  drm_fb_helper_memory_range_to_clip() function will also be 
called by

drm_fb_helper_sys_write() function(in drm_fb_helper.c) when running 
fbdev test.


Put restriction in drm_fb_helper_deferred_io() function solely is not 
enough,Â  because

drm_fb_helper_deferred_io() is for mmap code path to writing the shadow 
buffer.

It relative fast, because it does not need another copy from user.


However , drm_fb_helper_sys_write() is another code path to write to the 
shadow screen buffer.

it need copy from user to the kernel first, then copy to the shadow 
screen buffer,

and finally copy from the shadow to the real gem buffer. Â  Every time 
you want to write

the screen buffer, you have to issue a system call.


But for the mmap code path, I only need map it to userspace address 
space once.

Yeah, only once, with write-combine page table caching property for 
video ram.

but for the shadow buffer in system ram, using cached is more fast and 
reliable

because of cache coherentÂ  related concerns...

So, we have two ways to writing the shadow(screen) buffer in the system ram.

OK. But I still want to fix the two by one shot.

It makes me feel comfortable.
