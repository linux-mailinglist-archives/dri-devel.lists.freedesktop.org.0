--- Comment #53 from MasterCATZ (mastercatz@hotmail.com) ---
its been like this since mid  kernel 4's, just wish I knew whats locking that
file root has no permissions and it seems to activate @ 70 deg , which even if
i run the fan 100% will be reached unless I under clock 

amdgpupro just turns PC into a paperweight so I don't use that 
radeon drivers suck for any gaming  
amdgpu / mesa 
are what I need to use and its been like this since powerplay was introduced 

Ubuntu 18.04, and just upgraded it to 19.10 same issues 
currently using 5.4.2-050402-generic

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="amdgpu.ppfeaturemask=0xfffd7fff
amdgpu.ppfeaturemask=0xffffffff amdgpu.dc=1 amdgpu.cik_support=1
radeon.cik_support=0"

featuremasks seem to make no difference 
maybe I should re - add 
radeon.si_support=0  amdgpu.si_support=1

as  in as radeon profile is showing radeonsi is in use ?, 
but I thought R9 290 were Sea Islands = amdgpu.cik_support=1 ?
