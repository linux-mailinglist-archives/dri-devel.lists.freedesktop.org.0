I will add this in V2 as well. But I have found an another issue which is
not very frequent.

Looks this is because driver is unbind still Xorg is trying to write
to memory which is causing some page faults. I have confirmed PID 1522
is of Xorg. I think this is because we need to cancel the framebuffer
deferred work after flushing it.

After adding the below in hvfb_remove I don't see this issue anymore.
Although as the issue is not very frequent I am not 100% sure.

	cancel_delayed_work_sync(&info->deferred_work);

If you think this is reasonable I can add this as well in V2.
