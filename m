Yeah this all looks great and very hyperlinked.

I think the only nit I have is that for types with two or more type
variables (like the rbtree) what each of them should represent in the top
intro. I can guess it's <Key, Value> and not the other way round, but
confirmation takes quite a bit of scrolling to check with the function
types.

Otherwise I think perfect api docs.

Just a quick comment on this, that's the same we do on the C side. Most
overview chapters are actually DOC: sections pulled in from the code.

What I meant here is that for big overview stuff (like for modesetting how
the display pipe structures tie together as an example:
https://dri.freedesktop.org/docs/drm/gpu/drm-kms.html#overview)
it doesn't make sense to duplicate that in rustdoc once more.

Maybe drm is the exception, but if you look at our .rst files we also have
most of our docs in the code:

https://cgit.freedesktop.org/drm/drm/tree/Documentation/gpu/drm-kms-helpers.rst

The rst files just provide the scaffolding because C dosn't have
crates/modules hierarchy that would do this for you automatically.
