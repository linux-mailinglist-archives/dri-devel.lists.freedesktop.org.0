Okay, thanks for the explanation. I'm still puzzled by msm-4.14 defining
primary USB3 PHY as 'qcom,usb-ssphy-qmp-usb3-or-dp', but it might be
some kind of a hack or just a difference between QCS615 and SM6150.

If QCS615 follows other platforms of the same generation, I'd assume
that the correct way to handle it would be:

- Keep the primary USB3 PHY as is (it needs to be reposted though, the
  driver part didn't make it in).

- Extend the qmp-usbc driver to support USB+DP 'exclusive combo' PHYs by
  registering two PHYs for a single device. Make sure to continue
  supporting #phy-cells = 0 and region size = 0x1000. Use definitions
  from include/dt-bindings/phy/phy-qcom-qmp.h .

- Make sure that the PHY driver doesn't allow both PHYs to be powered
  on. Add TCSR programming to the power_on / power_off callbacks,
  implementing the switch between DP and USB3.

At this point all PHYs in qmp-usbc can be switched to the new USB+DP
configuration, still providing backwards compatibility with the existing
board DTs.
