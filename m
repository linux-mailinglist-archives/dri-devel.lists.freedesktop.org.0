What do you mean by _probably_ busted? This should either fail in 
kref_get_unless_zero for freed fences or it grabs the wrong fence which 
dma_fence_get_rcu_safe() is supposed to detect.

I don't have the story on dma_fence dependency chain deadlocks. Maybe 
put a few more words about that in the cover letter since it would be 
good to understand the real motivation behind the change.

Are there even bugs about deadlocks which should be mentioned?

Or why is not the act of fence being signaled removing the fence from 
the rcu protected containers, preventing the stale pointer problem?

My understanding is that lockless, eg. no reference taken, access can 
access a different fence or a freed fence, but won't cause use after 
free when under the rcu lock.

As long as dma fence users are going through the API entry points 
individual drivers should be able to handle things correctly.

Again, I think it can't be freed memory inside the rcu lock section. It 
can only be re-allocated or unused object.

Overall it looks like there is some complication involving the 
interaction between rcu protected pointers and SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU, 
rather than a simple statement i915 leaked/broke something for other 
drivers. And challenge of auditing drivers to make all use 
dma_fence_get_rcu_safe() when dealing with such storage.

To be clear I don't mind simplifications in principle as long as the 
problem statement is accurate.

And some benchmarks definitely need to be ran here. At least that was 
the usual thing in the past when such large changes were being proposed.

Tvrtko
