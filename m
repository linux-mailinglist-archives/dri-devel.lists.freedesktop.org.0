Ok, that's a bit big, but if there is no other way.

In this case it can work, but by using generic drm api, it's hard to 
know what the driver will do.

Would that work for you to put that in a drm_panic_helper.c,
so that drivers can opt-in ?

So the driver can call a drm_panic_helper_prepare_commit() at 
initialization, and then in the get_scanout_buffer() function, run the 
atomic_update() on it, and return this commit's framebuffer ?

That way each driver have a better control on what the panic handler 
will do.
It can even call directly its internal functions, to avoid the locks of 
the drm generic functions, and make sure it will only change the format 
and base address.
That's a bit more work for each driver, but should be more reliable I think.
