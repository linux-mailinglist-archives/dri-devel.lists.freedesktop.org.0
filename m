Sorry for the delay, other topics delayed my response on this one.

No, whether intf/wb block themselves are allocated through RM or not did 
not really go into this. It was just about considering where all 
hardware blocks make sense to be mapped : crtc or encoder. At the end, 
considering the dsc, cwb and some more blocks encoder id was used.

Correct and the reason it was able to seamlessly drop all the old 
resources was because of the encoder_id mapping, for the cwb use-case 
using crtc id will not be so seamless to release the resources.

There is some effort there from what I can see in the cwb case. I am 
unable to visualize how your rework will help that case. If you want to 
move this mapping to crtc id to that series to convince us how, then it 
is a better fit for that series.

Interesting point, but the DRM documentation seems to allow that and I 
think now thats one of the positives to have things in encoder's atomic 
check.

803 	 * This callback is used to validate encoder state for atomic drivers.
804 	 * Since the encoder is the object connecting the CRTC and connector it
805 	 * gets passed both states, to be able to validate interactions and
806 	 * update the CRTC to match what the encoder needs for the requested
807 	 * connector.
808 	 *

Encoder is the place where we have both the crtc and the connector state 
being passed down to. the crtc's atomic check doesnt have the states of 
encoder. So it just seems the encoder's atomic check is more centralized 
for the entire pipeline.

Yes for SSPPs, since they are connected to LMs and LM is mapped to CRTC 
yes its right that it will be better of to map to CRTC , only if we 
think about these two blocks in isolation. But if I would think that if 
we want to validate the pipeline encoder is more central.

I agree that moving from mode_set() to atomic_check() for the cstate had 
to be done. But like I wrote encoder being passed a crtc state is 
exactly for this purpose as its central to crtc and connector.

Overall, like I wrote in my last response, I am not against the idea but 
from your reasoning so far and from the responses i have given above, I 
do not think that this series demands this change necessarily. I think 
without this change, the virtual plane series itself is pretty small to 
review and will be an easier task to land that first. We should deal 
with it on a need basis rather than just deciding to use virtual planes 
to make this design change.
