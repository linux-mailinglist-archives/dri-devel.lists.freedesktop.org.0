Well, this copy is what we are trying to avoid here. The codec should 
pump the data into LMEM in the first place.

Yeah, but it's not the normal case for everybody.

We had numerous projects where customers wanted to pump video data 
directly from a decoder into an GPU frame or from a GPU frame into an 
encoder.

The fact that media frameworks doesn't support that out of the box is 
simply a bug.

Ok, let's stop with that. This isn't helpful in the technical discussion.

Yeah and that's fine, it just doesn't seem to work in all cases.

For both x86 as well as the case here that the CPU cache might be dirty 
the exporter needs to be the device with the requirements.

For x86 dGPUs that's the backing store is some local memory. For the 
non-coherent ARM devices it's that the CPU cache is not dirty.

For a device driver which solely works with cached system memory 
inserting cache flush operations is something it would never do for 
itself. It would just be doing this for the importer and exactly that 
would be bad design because we then have handling for the display driver 
outside of the driver.

Well, this is exactly what I'm criticizing on the DMA-API. Instead of 
giving you a proper error code when something won't work in a specific 
way it just tries to hide the requirements inside the DMA layer.

For example when your device can only access 32bits the DMA-API 
transparently insert bounce buffers instead of giving you a proper error 
code that the memory in question can't be accessed.

This just tries to hide the underlying problem instead of pushing it 
into the upper layer where it can be handled much more gracefully.

Christian.
