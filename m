I did multiple runs and I thought from the code changes it would be 
obvious there is some code there which should go.

But fair enough, I agree ministat is common practice so I re-did it. 
Five ~100 second runs each kernel. Absolute numbers are a bit different 
before I turned on some kernel hardening options since.
