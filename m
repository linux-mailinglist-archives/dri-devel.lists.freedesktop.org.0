Then I have not clearly communicated, as my opinion is not that
validation is worthless, but that the implementation is enshrining a
global property on a low level primitive that prevents it from being
used elsewhere. And I want to replace completion [chains] with fences, and
bio with fences, and closures with fences, and what other equivalencies
there are in the kernel. The fence is as central a locking construct as
struct completion and deserves to be a foundational primitive provided
by kernel/ used throughout all drivers for discrete problem domains.

This is narrowing dma_fence whereby adding
	struct lockdep_map *dma_fence::wait_map
and annotating linkage, allows you to continue to specify that all
dma_fence used for a particular purpose must follow common rules,
without restricting the primitive for uses outside of this scope.
