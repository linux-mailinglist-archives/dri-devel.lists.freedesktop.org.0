No, the CTS doesnt say we need to finish link training within 10ms after 
HPD is asserted. It says it must be completed in 10ms after 
TRAINING_PATTERN_SET dpcd write.

"Wait until the Source DUT writes 00h to the TRAINING_PATTERN_SET byte 
of Reference Sink DPCD Link Configuration Field to indicate the end of 
the link training. Stop the link training timer. Verify that link 
training completed in 10ms or less"

That needs to be done independent of HPD so we can ignore the CTS point.

Its the corrective action of the userspace when it finds link is bad is 
the concern as I highlighted in the other response. Just reading and 
resetting link_status is not enough to recover.
