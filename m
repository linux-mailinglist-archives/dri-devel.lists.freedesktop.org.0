It's still worth spelling out that this is fixing a bug where the 
current code should have been using table->orig_nents - it's just that 
switching to the sgtable helper is the best way to make the fix, since 
it almost entirely removes the possibility of making that (previously 
rather common) mistake.

If it helps, for the change itself:
