--- Comment #31 from Richard Thier <u9vata@gmail.com> ---
While bisecting the original issue I saw a point where speed was already ba=
d,
but not that much as with latest however mostly like that (at least 90-95%).

So there might be a little bit more speedup gain if someone or me bisects
between 04ea03d99d8 and the latest to see when is the minor slowdown, but it
might not worth it as it is so small that it might be less than 1% in effec=
t.
Just documenting this as I still see this from strace output after the quic=
kfix
patch - but not visible or measurable when playing or running 3D apps.

At least now there is a quickfix solution based on Marek's attachment that
works with 19.x too - enjoy ;-)
