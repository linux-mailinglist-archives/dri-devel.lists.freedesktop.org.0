Having dug some more, I see that this was intended to handle the way
the hardware shares a single config register between pairs of counter
and counter_ext registers, with the idea being that two related events
could be allocated into the same counter pair (but would only occupy a
single counter each).

I still think the code is wrong, but it is more complex than I made it
out to be, and you're right that we should leave it as-is for now. I can
follow up after we've got this series in.

Mark.
