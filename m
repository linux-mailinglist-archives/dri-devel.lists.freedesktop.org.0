Indeed! I had forgotten about that. All the uses of TFP410 I have seen 
have been without i2c, thus no usable HPD.

Yes. I was mirroring the connector use case with what Doug described 
here: both the connector and the bridge with no HPD related properties. 
My point was that while Doug says HPD is assumed to be hooked up to the 
bridge, we don't have that kind of assumption in the general sense: the 
HPD may or may not be hooked up to the bridge, depends on the device. 
But the connector does not handle it.

Well... Maybe. One never knows what the HW guys come up with ;). But if 
the bridge handled HPD IRQ, I have hard time imagining a case where it 
couldn't also handle the plug/unplug HPD.

Right, that's what I meant. It is then case 1.
