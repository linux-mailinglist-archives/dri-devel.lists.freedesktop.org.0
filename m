--- Comment #8 from Ilia Mirkin (imirkin@alum.mit.edu) ---
Well, the problem the other users were having is that their GPUs were actually
missing the crypt engine entirely, and we were not properly reading the
capabilities bits that indicated this. Trying to use the crypt engine when it's
not actually there has some obvious downsides :) But I don't see an indication
that this would be the case on your setup. (First of all, we now respect the
capability bit, and secondly, you don't have any mmio read/write errors in that
range.)
