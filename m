[disclaimer]
Please note that as this series includes patches which touch a good number of
drivers, I did not copy everyone on everything. Assumption is people are
subscribed to dri-devel and for context can look at the whole series there.
[/disclaimer]

As a summary, the new scheduling algorithm is insipired by the original Linux
CFS and so far no scheduling regressions have been found relative to FIFO.
There are improvements in fairness and scheduling of interactive clients when
running in parallel with a heavy GPU load (for example Pierre-Eric has one
viewperf medical test which shows a nice improvement with amdgpu).

On the high level main advantages of the series are:

 1. Scheduling quality - schedules better than FIFO, solves priority starvation.
 2. Code simplification - no more multiple run queues and multiple algorithms.
 3. Virtual GPU time based scheduling enables relatively simple addition
    of a scheduling cgroup controller in the future.

There is a little bit more detailed write up on the motivation and results in
the form of a blog post which may be easier to read:
https://blogs.igalia.com/tursulin/fair-er-drm-gpu-scheduler/

First patches add some unit tests which allow for easy evaluation of scheduling
behaviour against different client submission patterns. From there onwards it is
hopefully a natural progression of cleanups, enablers, adding the fair policy,
and finally removing FIFO and RR and simplifying the code base due no more need
for multiple run queues.

Series is structured in a way where we could apply the first 12 patches (up to
and including "drm/sched: Switch default policy to fair") in one kernel release
and then follow up with the rest of the cleanups after a release or two if
things will be looking fine. Until the remainder of the series would be merged
it would be easy to flip the default algorithm back.

Onto the performance evaluation. As a headline result I have tested three
simultaneous clients on the Steam Deck:

One instance of a deferredmultisampling Vulkan demo running with low priority,
one normal priority instance of the same demo, and the Unigine Heaven benchmark.

With the FIFO scheduler we can see that the low priority client is completely
starved and the GPU time distribution between the other two clients is uneven:

https://people.igalia.com/tursulin/drm-sched-fair/fifo-starvation.png

Switching to the fair scheduler, GPU time distribution is almost equal and the
low priority client does get a small share of the GPU:

https://people.igalia.com/tursulin/drm-sched-fair/fair-no-starvation.png

Moving onto the synthetic submission patterns, they are about two simultaneous
clients which broadly cover the following categories:

 * Deep queue clients
 * Hogs versus interactive
 * Priority handling

Lets look at the results:

1. Two normal priority deep queue clients.

These ones submit one second worth of 8ms jobs. As fast as they can, no
dependencies etc. There is no difference in runtime between FIFO and fair but
the latter allows both clients to progress with work more evenly:

https://people.igalia.com/tursulin/drm-sched-fair/normal-normal.png

(X axis is time, Y is submitted queue-depth, hence lowering of qd corresponds
  with work progress for both clients, tested with both schedulers separately.)

Round-robin is the same as fair here.

2. Same two clients but one is now low priority.

https://people.igalia.com/tursulin/drm-sched-fair/normal-low.png

Normal priority client is a solid line, low priority dotted. We can see how FIFO
completely starves the low priority client until the normal priority is fully
done. Only then the low priority client gets any GPU time.

In constrast, fair scheduler allows some GPU time to the low priority client.

Here round-robin flavours are the same as FIFO (same starvation issue).

3. Same clients but now high versus normal priority.

Similar behaviour as in the previous one with normal a bit less de-prioritised
relative to high, than low was against normal.

https://people.igalia.com/tursulin/drm-sched-fair/high-normal.png

And again round-robin flavours are the same as FIFO.

4. Heavy load vs interactive client.

Heavy client emits a 75% GPU load in the format of 3x 2.5ms jobs followed by a
2.5ms wait. Interactive client emits a 10% GPU load in the format of 1x 1ms job
followed by a 9ms wait.

This simulates an interactive graphical client used on top of a relatively heavy
background load but no GPU oversubscription.

Graphs show the interactive client only and from now on, instead of looking at
the client's queue depth, we look at its "fps".

https://people.igalia.com/tursulin/drm-sched-fair/251008/4-heavy-vs-interactive.png

Here round-robin and round-robin rewritten on top of FIFO are best, with the
fair algorithm being very close. FIFO is clearly the worst.

5. An even heavier load vs interactive client.

This one is oversubscribing the GPU by submitting 4x 50ms jobs and waiting for
only one microsecond before repeating the cycle. Interactive client is the same
10% as above.

https://people.igalia.com/tursulin/drm-sched-fair/251008/4-very-heavy-vs-interactive.png

Here FIFO is even worse and fair is again almost as good as the two round-robin
flavours.

6. Low priority GPU hog versus heavy-interactive.

Low priority client: 3x 2.5ms jobs client followed by a 0.5ms wait.
Interactive client: 1x 0.5ms job followed by a 10ms wait.

https://people.igalia.com/tursulin/drm-sched-fair/251008/4-low-hog-vs-interactive.png

All schedulers appear to handle this almost equally well but FIFO could still be
the last while fair has a slight lead.

As before, I am looking for feedback, ideas for what other kinds of submission
scenarios to test, testing on different GPUs and of course reviews.
