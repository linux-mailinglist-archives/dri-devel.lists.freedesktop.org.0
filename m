fcntl() will call security_file_fcntl(). IIRC, Android uses selinux and
I'm pretty certain they'd disallow any fcntl() operations they deems
unsafe. So a kernel update for them would likely require allow-listing
the new fcntl(). Or if they do allow all new fnctl()s by default they'd
have to disallow it if they thought that's an issue but really I don't
even think there's any issue in that.

I think kcmp() is a different problem because you can use it to compare
objects from different tasks. The generic fcntl() wouldn't allow that.
