--- Comment #100 from mnrzk@protonmail.com ---
I posted the patch on the LKML [1] just now so I can get the other
reviewers' input on it. I think it's safe to say that it's working now due
to how much I've tested it but I will test more over the coming days just
to be safe.

If anyone else can test this patch and give their Tested-by in the LKML
thread, or just comment in here about it, please do.

Aside from the description, this patch is identical to the one I just
attached.

Nicholas, sorry but I wasn't quite sure if you were giving a suggestion in
that comment earlier. Please tell me if you have any suggestions or
concerns with this patch.
