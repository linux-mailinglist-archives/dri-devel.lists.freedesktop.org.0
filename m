Well the email above wasn't really about the correctness of this 
particular patch (I should probably have altered the subject to reflect 
that) but rather about the assumption that failures that should never 
occur in a production system are not worth spending time on selftests for.

For the patch itself, I'll take a deeper look at the patch and get back.
