Yes, in this series there is a struct drm_scanout_buffer, that the 
driver has to provide when a panic occurs:

struct drm_scanout_buffer {
	const struct drm_format_info *format;
	struct iosys_map map;
	unsigned int pitch;
	unsigned int width;
	unsigned int height;
};

That works well for CPU accessible, linear format.
It should be possible to support YUV, or simple tiling with that, but 
for the more complex case, I proposed to add a draw_pixel() callback.

Thanks, I was also wondering why a panic teardown would be necessary, 
since after the panic handler has run, the system will probably halt. 
(or maybe run kdump and reboot).
