--- Comment #169 from picard12@live.de ---
I am using a Radeon VII with Arch Linux, a 1440p144hz and a 4K60Hz monitor,=
 and
I had similar crashes to the others here if I tried running the 1440p144hz
monitor at 144hz, at 60hz it was stable. This behavior stayed all the way f=
rom
kernel 5.0 up to 5.3, and only stopped when I started using kernel 5.4.0
(5.4.0-rc6-mainline right now). Now I can run it at 144hz without crashes.

The driver still isn't working that well, as games seem very stuttery, but =
at
least it doesn't crash anymore.
