This series introduces the enabling patches for new flat ccs feature and
64k page support for i915 local memory, along with documentation on the
uAPI impact.

64k page support
================

On discrete platforms, starting from DG2, we have to contend with GTT
page size restrictions when dealing with I915_MEMORY_CLASS_DEVICE
objects. Specifically the hardware only supports 64K or larger GTT page
sizes for such memory. The kernel will already ensure that all
I915_MEMORY_CLASS_DEVICE memory is allocated using 64K or larger page
sizes underneath.

Note that the returned size here will always reflect any required
rounding up done by the kernel, i.e 4K will now become 64K on devices
such as DG2. The GTT alignment will also need be at least 64K for such
objects.

Note that due to how the hardware implements 64K GTT page support, we
have some further complications:

1.) The entire PDE(which covers a 2M virtual address range), must
contain only 64K PTEs, i.e mixing 4K and 64K PTEs in the same PDE is
forbidden by the hardware.

2.) We still need to support 4K PTEs for I915_MEMORY_CLASS_SYSTEM
objects.

To handle the above the kernel implements a memory coloring scheme to
prevent userspace from mixing I915_MEMORY_CLASS_DEVICE and
I915_MEMORY_CLASS_SYSTEM objects in the same PDE. If the kernel is ever
unable to evict the required pages for the given PDE(different color)
when inserting the object into the GTT then it will simply fail the
request.

Since userspace needs to manage the GTT address space themselves,
special care is needed to ensure this doesnâ€™t happen. The simplest
scheme is to simply align and round up all I915_MEMORY_CLASS_DEVICE
objects to 2M, which avoids any issues here. At the very least this is
likely needed for objects that can be placed in both
I915_MEMORY_CLASS_DEVICE and I915_MEMORY_CLASS_SYSTEM, to avoid
potential issues when the kernel needs to migrate the object behind the
scenes, since that might also involve evicting other objects.

To summarise the GTT rules, on platforms like DG2:

1.) All objects that can be placed in I915_MEMORY_CLASS_DEVICE must have
64K alignment. The kernel will reject this otherwise.

2.) All I915_MEMORY_CLASS_DEVICE objects must never be placed in the
same PDE with other I915_MEMORY_CLASS_SYSTEM objects. The kernel will
reject this otherwise.

3.) Objects that can be placed in both I915_MEMORY_CLASS_DEVICE and
I915_MEMORY_CLASS_SYSTEM should probably be aligned and padded out to
2M.

Flat CCS:
=========
Gen 12+ devices support 3D surfaces compression and compression formats.
This is accomplished by an additional compression control state (CCS)
stored for each surface.

Gen 12 devices(TGL and DG1) stores compression state in a separate
region of memory. It is managed by userspace and has an associated set
of userspace managed page tables used by hardware for address
translation.

In Gen 12.5 devices(XEXPSDV and DG2) Flat CCS is introduced to replace
the userspace managed AUX pagetable with the flat indexed region of
device memory for storing the compression state

GOP Driver steals a chunk of memory for the CCS surface corresponding to
the entire range of local memory. The memory required for the CCS of the
entire local memory is 1/256 of the main local memory. The Gop driver
will also program a secure register (XEHPSDV_FLAT_CCS_BASE_ADDR 0x4910)
with this address value.

TODO: add patches for the flatccs modifiers and kdoc for them.
