I was also thinking about GPU-PRO but i would want to install Ubuntu LTS on
another disk then. That might take several weeks for me to test or even lon=
ger.
And i am not even sure if thats super helpful. Im pretty sure at least on A=
rch
at the end of 2018 i had zero problems. At least with my Vega ;-)
Maybe i was wrong switching from green to red after 10 years. hehe
