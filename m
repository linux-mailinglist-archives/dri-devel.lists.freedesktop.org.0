"If", "may", that's still a lot of conditionals in your sentence :)

I do not have enough knowledge to prove or disprove this, but what I am
sure of is that this uncertainty tells me that this is not something I
want to touch myself.

I picked up this stalled fixed width patch series and re-spinned it
because I had confidence here. I do not want to extend this series with
some asm clean-up which looks uncertain to me. I am not telling you are
wrong but just that I will happily delegate this to whoever has more
confidence than me!

How do you know that there isn't someone somewhere who is using the uapi
__GENMASK*() in their userland asm code? Wouldn't such code break?

You may argue that the uapi is not meant to be used that way, but at the
end, we are not supposed to make assumptions on how the uapi code will
be used. Once it is exposed, if something break because the uapi was not
used in the intended way, it is still the kernel fault, not the userland.
