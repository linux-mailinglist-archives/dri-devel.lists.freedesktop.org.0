No, sorry, this is completely nonsensical.

Even with the current Colorspace property that we want to deprecate, 
drivers doing an implicit conversion from RGB -> to YCC should respect 
the colorspace property to pick the right matrix coefficients here.

Doing so simply introduces a useless mismatch that is unavoidable from 
userspace and makes absolutely no sense.

Arguing about this is kind of completely useless anyway... as we are 
deprecating this property... Let's pleeeease let it die.

I am not sure why these patches were re-submitted with my RB again after 
we had the discussion previously about making a new one that's actually 
going to get tested and have userspace consumers.

(FTR, I guess Gamescope *is* a userspace consumer for this broken 
property right now, but I am completely happy for AMDGPU upstream to 
never support this and to just move onto the new property and leave this 
one behind).

Yes.

That is what Ville is describing and what I disagree with, yes.

But whether or not Ville or I agree on that is kind of irrelevant as we 
are going to deprecate the property... right... right?

Yeah.
