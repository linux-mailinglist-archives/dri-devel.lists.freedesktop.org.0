+==========================
+I915 Small BAR RFC Section
+==========================
+Starting from DG2 we will have resizable BAR support for device local-memory,
+but in some cases the final BAR size might still be smaller than the total
+local-memory size. In such cases only part of local-memory will be CPU
+accessible, while the remainder is only accessible via the GPU.
+
+I915_GEM_CREATE_EXT_FLAG_NEEDS_CPU_ACCESS flag
+----------------------------------------------
+New gem_create_ext flag to tell the kernel that a BO will require CPU access.
+The becomes important when placing an object in LMEM, where underneath the
+device has a small BAR, meaning only part of it is CPU accessible. Without this
+flag the kernel will assume that CPU access is not required, and prioritize
+using the non-CPU visible portion of LMEM(if present on the device).
+
+Related to this, we now also reject any objects marked with
+EXEC_OBJECT_CAPTURE, which are also not tagged with NEEDS_CPU_ACCESS. This only
+impacts DG2+.
+
+XXX: One open here is whether we should extend the memory region query to return
+the CPU visible size of the region. For now the IGTs just use debugfs to query
+the size. However, if userspace sees a real need for this then extending the
+region query would be a lot nicer.
+
+.. kernel-doc:: Documentation/gpu/rfc/i915_small_bar.h
+   :functions: __drm_i915_gem_create_ext
+
+DRM_I915_QUERY_VMA_INFO query
+-----------------------------
+Query the attributes of some vma. Given a vm and GTT offset, find the
+respective vma, and return its set of attrubutes. For now we only support
+DRM_I915_QUERY_VMA_INFO_CPU_VISIBLE, which is set if the object/vma is
+currently placed in memory that is accessible by the CPU. This should always be
+set on devices where the CPU visible size of LMEM matches the probed size. If
+this is not set then CPU faulting the object will first require migrating the
+pages.
