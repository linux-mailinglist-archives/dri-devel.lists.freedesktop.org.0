I've doubts about the need to move out the dma_resv_lock() into the
callers of dma_buf_vmap()..

I looked through all the dma_buf_vmap() users and neither of them
interacts with dma_resv_lock() at all, i.e. nobody takes the lock
in/outside of dma_buf_vmap(). Hence it's easy and more practical to make
dma_buf_mmap/vmap() to take the dma_resv_lock by themselves.

It's unclear to me which driver may ever want to do the mapping under
the dma_resv_lock. But if we will ever have such a driver that will need
to map imported buffer under dma_resv_lock, then we could always add the
dma_buf_vmap_locked() variant of the function. In this case the locking
rule will sound like this:

"All dma-buf importers are responsible for holding the dma-reservation
lock around the dmabuf->ops->mmap/vmap() calls."

Do we have any tests for dma-bufs at all? It's unclear to me what you
are going to test in regards to the reservation locks, could you please
clarify?
