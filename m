The hardware will drop the 8bit alpha anyway, there is no image quality 
loss. So I find it better to drop it before sending it to the hardware 
to save bandwidth. As the mgag200 doesn't expose any other 
functionality, the userspace can't even read the VRAM back, so it's 
unlikely to cause issue.

I don't think userspace cares much about very old hardware like this 
one. I would rather make it work as good as possible with current userspace.
For example Gnome/Wayland won't work in 16bit or 24bit pixel depth, and 
it would be much harder to add support in the compositor than this ~36 
lines patch. Other compositors are probably expecting 32bit hardware too.
mgag200 is also likely the last hardware from this era that's still 
alive, so we can't expect userspace to add specific support for it.


We can still change the format array order, but I would put 24bit first, 
as 16 bit is a bit ugly nowadays.
