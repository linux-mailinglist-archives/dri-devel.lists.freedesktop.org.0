The reason it matters is that for Yocto, the generated header file is 
identified as a file that needs to be installed into the sysroot.  All 
files going into the sysroot are checked to make sure they do not 
contain dates and/or paths to the build directory contained within. 
Since this is a generated header file that is included in the sysroot we 
needed to strip out the path and date.

The idea for the reproducible builds are that the same files on a 
different a machine at a different time should produce 100% identical 
files.  Including paths and dates violates that tenet.

Hope that helps explain why we needed this.  So long as the 
gen_header.py is being called to generate header files then we need to 
maintain the reproducible aspect.
