Yes, wrote so myself - "..again with no guarantees they are still there 
at use time..".

Perhaps I don't understand what problem is probe supposed to solve. It 
doesn't deal 1:1 with set_domain removal since that one actually did 
get_pages so that would be populate. But fact remains regardless that if 
userspace is given a pointer it doesn't trust, _and_ wants the check it 
for this reason or that, then probe solves nothing. Unless there is 
actually at minimum some protocol to reply to whoever sent the pointer 
like "not that pointer please".

Yeah I am guessing if anyone is using some of the other userptr flags 
they don't have a getparam for that either. At least that would be 
consolidated with I915_PARAM_USERPTR_SUPPORTED_FLAGS. There is no 
requirement that getparam needs to keep supporting future extensions to 
the struct itself, equally as I915_PARAM_HAS_USERPTR_PROBE is directly 
tied to the same flags field, only a subset of it.
